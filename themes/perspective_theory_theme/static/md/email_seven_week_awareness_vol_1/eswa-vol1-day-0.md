## Welcome

Hello, and thank you for subscribing to the 7 Week Awareness Challenge Vol 1.

This series has been designed to assist you better understand, as well as appreciate the awareness exercises available on the website.

They will be delivered to you on a weekly basis, so you can truly take the time to appreciate and understand them, and each volume has been structured to provide you with specific pathways which will help you gain the most out of your 7 weeks. 



This series has been designed to help those new to meditation, as well serve as a strong foundation for those wanting to learn more about meditation best practice.

You will be receiving a new guided meditation each day over the coming 10 days, which will take you through a variety of concepts and topics.

I have picked these topics specifically to help you become more familiar with the various ways we can explore meditation.

While these meditations have been created with a specific order in mind, you are more than welcome to repeat these meditations in any order you like, if you find particular meditations useful.

If this is your first time meditating, then you're in for a real treat, and I hope this audio series sparks a new-found love for mental health practice in your life.

There's absolutely nothing more special than having your own mental health in order, and that's something I hope to share with you over the coming days.

## Next Steps

I wish you best of luck with your journey.
