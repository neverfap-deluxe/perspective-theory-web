## Day 5 - Observe What You See

Welcome to Day 5 of the 10 Day Meditation Primer.

In today's meditation we will be focusing on


## Script

Hello and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe 10 day meditation primer.

My name is Julius Reade, and on day five, we are going to observe what is in front of us. 

Observation is a key skill when it comes to meditation, which can help us be more present with ourselves.

Essentially, what I want you to do, without moving your eyes, or searching, is to observe what is in front of you right now.

There is nothing to question. Nothing to think about. All we are doing is observing what is in front of us.



What do you see?

You know, an interesting thing that happens when I ask that question.

What usually happens is that people will start thinking about what’s in front of them.

They’ll start trying to identify that which they are looking at.

Without realising that observation doesn’t require thought.

Your eyes are already seeing and observing.

They are already sensing your surroundings, regardless of what your mind thinks.

Which is to say that what we want to focus on is that sensing, rather than that thinking aspect we’re so used to.

So with that said, simply observe what’s in front of you.

Without thought.

Without expectation.

And I’ll let you do this for a few minutes.



If you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

Of course, you may not be used to observing.

Instead, you may be used to thinking.

They’re quite different concepts.

But that’s okay, because the skill we’re developing is an important skill.

Which will allow you to quiet your mind.

Gain control over your thoughts.

And simply exist with the present moment.

Calm.

Relaxed.

Essentially, in observation.



If you find your mind wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.

To continue to truly notice what is in front of you.

And that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.
