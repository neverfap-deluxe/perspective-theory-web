## Script

Hello and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe 10 day meditation primer.

My name is Julius Reade, and on day three, we are going to explore this fundamental idea of awareness.

Awareness is important for a number of reasons.

And without conscious change, we essentially leave our recovery and our ability to learn, up to pure chance.


Most people struggle with awareness, because it's a skill most people have not practiced extensively.
