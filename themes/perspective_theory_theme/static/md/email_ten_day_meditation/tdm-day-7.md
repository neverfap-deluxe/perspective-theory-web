## Day 7 - Observe What You Hear

Welcome to Day 7 of the 10 Day Meditation Primer.

In today's meditation we will be focusing on


## Script


Hello and welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe 10 day meditation primer.

My name is Julius Reade, and on day seven, we are going to focus on the feeling of touch.

Touch is such an important part of the human experience, yet it's rarely something we ever focus on.

So today, we will be exploring touch and how that makes you feel.

Using two fingers from your left or right hand, I want you to gently touch the surface of something. 

It could be an object in front of you, such a table. 

It could even be your own skin in some form, such as using your right hand to touch your left hand. 

And with that touch, I want you to slowly move your fingers up and down that object. 

Taking notice of the feeling.

Furthermore, being fully present with that feeling in your mind. 

And I'll let you do this within your own space.


What does that object feel like?

Is it a pleasant feeling? 

Does it evoke any particular emotions?



Throughout this series, what we are ultimately aiming to do is develop our skills in observation.
