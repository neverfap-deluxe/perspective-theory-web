      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p>Before you begin, I highly recommend becoming familiar with <a class="link" href="/articles/the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap">The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</a>.</p>
      <p>These principles will form the basis of everything you will learn, whether you decide to get started with the courses, read the articles or practice the mental health exercises.</p>
      <p>Because in most cases, the reason why you're addicted to porn is because you've <u>neglected at least one of these principles in some form</u>.</p>
      <p>These five principles are: Choice over mind, Balance over reward, Awareness over all, Struggle over none and Uncondition over judgement.</p>
      <p>And until you master all five principles, it will be very difficult for you to truly be comfortable with your porn recovery and to succeed with any amount of certainty.</p>

      <h2>NeverFap Deluxe Articles</h2>

      <p>These articles will serve as a strong basis for your porn recovery, and are referenced within the NeverFap Deluxe Courses. In fact, the courses are generally the best way to consume the articles.</p>
      <p>The articles contained within the <a class="link" href="/courses/introduction/">Introduction course</a> are an excellent place to start with your NeverFap Deluxe journey. They will provide you with a better understanding of the NeverFap method of overcoming porn addiction.</p>

      <h2>NeverFap Deluxe Practices</h2>

      <p>NeverFap Deluxe Practices focus solely on verifiable steps you can take on a daily basis to help you progress towards learning the skills to end your porn addiction.</p>
      <p>This is where you'll be spending a majority of your time, practicing these skills and exercises so that you can become comfortable with using them in everyday situations.</p>
      <p>The most fundamental practice you can learn is <a class="link" href="/practices/observe-your-senses">Observe Your Senses</a>. It is the only practice referenced as part of the Introduction course and it is the exercise you will practice everyday, regardless of whatever other exercises you choose to adopt.</p>
      <p>It is arguably the most important thing you can do for your mental health, and to be quite honest, you could probably overcome your porn addiction with this one practice alone.</p>
      <p>Do yourself a favour and commit.</p>

      <h2>NeverFap Deluxe Courses</h2>

      <p>NeverFap Deluxe Courses combine the NeverFap Articles and Practices into single, linear progression-based pathways based upon The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap.</p>
      <p>They are designed to help you focus on a particular area of understanding, so that you can master that concept and feel confident with your ability to address your porn addiction.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, I recommend getting started with the Introduction course and working your way down the list, revisiting practices you personally found useful.</p>
      <p>In addition, these courses will also be available as premium audio courses if you decide to <a class="link" href="/accounts">sign up</a> with a NeverFap Deluxe Community account. (although they don't yet exist, so stay tuned!)</p>
