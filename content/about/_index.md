My name is Julius Reade. I am a freelance writer from Melbourne Australia. I use this website as an outlet to write about the manifestations of delusion and the ways it can encompass our lives. My other significant projects include [The Zero Hedge Daily Round Up](https://www.youtube.com/user/thefinancialreality) and [The Financial Reality](https://www.youtube.com/user/thefinancialreality). I completed my Bachelor of Journalism at Monash University in 2014.


### About myself and this website.


I am a very curious person and my personality has always driven me to seek answers within my own life and others. I am a very self-driven individual which is why I have sought a qualified mental health professional.

I created this website with the intention of catering to other self-driven individuals, who intuitively want to understand how their mind works. People approach psychologists with the idea in mind that they can provide them with answers. Ultimately, it is those who understand that only they have the answers and authority to their questions, which will deal with mental illness most effectively.

Much human emotional suffering is unwarranted, yet it may exist in our lives without second thought. We either presume that we do not have the power to change who we are or that these traits are temporary and I hope this website can prove these notions incorrect.


### Why I write perspective well.


The reason why I am an efficient perspective writer is a) because I have a lot of experience and knowledge with mental health issues and b) because of the way my mind interprets information.

I have one great flaw as a person. I have an incomplete memory. I can barely remember what happened yesterday, let alone one week ago. All these memories are absent in my mind, though they can still be recalled after a concentrated effort.

As a result, I am forgetful of the bad and harmful logic in my mind. The assumptions, the judgments, the expectations of self-worth etc. These are qualities that have been instilled into the physical structure of my brain and perspective is the only thing preventing them from exaggerating and wrecking havoc to my mental health.

However because I am forgetful, this is a futile act. Inevitably I become overwhelmed after a period of time, as it is impossible to remember everything and the cycle starts again. Also in order to successfully create the required perspective I need for each day and/or situation, I need to spend at least a few hours each day writing and sorting through my logic and unfortunately, I do not always have the time.

So naturally, I have become very good at processing my thoughts and understanding the faulty assumptions that people use to underpin their beliefs. It also means that I have become amazing at improvising perspective, simply because I've gone through it so many times before.


### Why self-awareness?


I believe in the method of self-awareness as an effective tool to help alleviate emotional suffering.

To a large extent, it is very difficult to change who we are. While I do believe it is possible to change our beliefs, and certainly I have changed many, I believe it is ultimately counter-productive because our personality tends to revert back to the person who we feel we should be, even if it is benign and destructive.

The alternative is to understand who we are and what is required to keep our checks and balances in place. I argue that a majority of the emotional pain we experience is because of the logical inconsistencies and fallacies that we create for ourselves. It is the basis for all the poor judgments, faulty assumptions, frustration, sadness etc.

With perspective we can hope to understand and expose this bad logic and come to a consensus. I believe our mental illness is a facet of logic, because I would continually fall into depression and experience negative emotional reactions, until I started questioning and understanding the way I think.


### Is self-awareness for everyone?


It's important to understand that self-awareness is merely a tool. The effectiveness of how you use it is up to you. I believe it has the potential to prevent mental illness, though the stage of your recovery and your own understanding of who you are, will also affect how you can use it.

Perspective is a form of self-awareness and it requires an understanding of logic to grasp. While some of the logic in my articles can be complex, I also cover basic emotional logic, such as how we make judgments and even how we focus.

Unfortunately, some people don't like to think about their problems. They like to hide away and slip down into the rabbit hole while the world around them ceases to exist. These are the ones I cannot help directly, especially since I am not there in person.


### Inspiration for the website.


Often you will see so-called 'happy' people who are incredibly judgmental or people who may be considered 'successful' yet are also completely miserable with their lives. With self-awareness, not only can we reverse these trends, however we can experience the clarity of our emotions without confusion or conflict.

As you can probably imagine I suffer from a lot of mental health issues. Most of my friends have issues as well so I've been able to observe the spectrum of insanity over the years. People with severe drug addictions, crippling insecurities, incessant thoughts of suicide, a complete absence of emotion - you name it.

The tipping point for me however, was the aftermath of my first relationship with a girl who was also mentally ill. The outcome was particularly tragic and from that point on, I decided to dedicate my life to understanding my own mental illness, as well as the mental illness of others.

I now feel like I have enough perspective in my life to lead a happy existence and I learn more about myself everyday. Of course, perspective is merely a way of reorganizing our thoughts and understanding of who we are. Happiness itself is jut a simple, pleasurable emotion.
