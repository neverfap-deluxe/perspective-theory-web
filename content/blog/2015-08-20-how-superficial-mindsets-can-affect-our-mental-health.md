**Overview:** Humans can be unnecessarily superficial at the best of times. While there are valid reasons for making these thoughtless generalisations, unconsciously relying on superficial interpretations to derive meaning is a sure-fire way to developing mental illness. Overtime our superficial judgements can develop cognitively into overarching mindsets and beget dysfunction, self-criticism and addiction. This article attempts to explain how we can develop superficial mindsets.

I was recently sifting through a number of inspiring quotes online.

What struck me most was the fact that all these quotes differed wildly in terms of the message that they were attempting to convey.

All the quotes I looked at concerned the topic of ambition and yet some quotes were wildly against ambition, while others were happily in support of it. Nonetheless they were all equally inspiring and convincing.

It made me realise how humans can latch onto ideas without truly thinking about them, simply because they are well presented or sound beautiful to the ear.

When we watch a televised presidential debate we can listen to 10 extremely articulate people present their message and be utterly convinced of them all, even if they all differ wildly in terms of policy and message.

What was apparent to me was that we can seemingly allow ourselves to get caught up in the words, rhetoric and exterior of a message (the face value), as opposed to the intention and meaning of what is actually being said.

Without questioning the information we consume, we cannot hope to derive deeper meaning to help us attain purpose in life.

Does this politician actually care about the environment with such vigour or is he simply saying these things to win the election at any cost? On the contrary, perhaps I am merely writing a depression website as a means to become famous, rather than because I genuinely want to help people.

It can help to ask these kinds of questions to obtain a clearer understanding of what life simply is, assuming we do not take these questions personally or turn them into assumptions.


### Digging a little deeper beneath the surface.


Superficial means to exist or occur on the surface. It comprises of things like our appearance, the way we talk, our height etc.

It can help to think of superficiality as a roadblock to discovering purpose.

When we limit ourselves to view things at a face value perspective, we completely neglect ourselves the opportunity to derive deeper meaning from what we are experiencing.

This is detrimental for a number of reasons. Not only can we cognitively develop neurological mindsets through these superficial judgements, however superficiality itself fails to find any deeper meaning in life - especially when it comes to developing a self-understanding of who we are.

In many ways superficiality is the opposite of self-awareness.

It is an attempt to find purpose in self-delusion by embracing ignorance as a more accurate representation of reality. Of course, we never sell it to ourselves like that. We simply do not go deep enough into our thought process to have these kinds of realisations.

One of the reasons why we end up developing these mindsets is because superficiality invariably works.

Focusing on our appearance can be an incredibly effective way of getting people's attention, since that is all we really notice of 99% of the strangers we see everyday. What we fail to question is why getting other people's attention is something necessary or important to our lives, which extends itself to being superficial.

In a lot of cases maintaining our appearance is an unavoidable requirement, like how we need to dress a certain way for work or school.

Because so much of our lives rely on superficial interpretation, it can be easy to view superficiality as something harmless or benign.

However once we we start taking superficial appearances personally to the point that it affects the way we feel about ourselves, we can begin placing more emphasis on what we look like, rather than who are as individuals.

Humans are intelligent creatures by design. If we were just shells with no personality, then I'm sure maintaining nothing but our appearance would be a valid case.

However humans are complex creatures with an intricate ability to create and derive meaning from anything. Arguably it is our one great advantage as human beings so why do so many people ignore it?

Precisely, it is something which we cannot ignore.

Pretending that this aspect of humanity does not exist, no matter how much you believe in the importance of ideas such as appearance, can only result in cognitive dissonance and delusion.


### The slow descent into mental illness.


As much as we would like to say that personality reigns above all, our eyes would suggest otherwise and in a lot of cases it can simply comes down to personal preference.

Biologically speaking it is because humans have a habit of generalising what they see. We all make a whole range of different assumptions on a daily basis about how friendly, rich or privileged someone is or based on the way they look or dress.

Generalising saves us time because in 99% of daily situations we can assume our generalisations to be right.

More importantly, our generalisations do not care if they are right or wrong, only if they make us feel right and justified - which further drives us to make even more unnecessary judgements.

On a more fundamental level, we can learn to generalise as a way of protecting ourselves from mixing with the wrong crowd and preventing harm.

If we had a bad experience with bikers, then we can be sure to avoid bikers the next time we see them.

The only issue with maintaining these kinds of generalisations is that we can begin to overgeneralise rather than rely on our own ability to make thoughtful decisions in life. This is particularly evident when we experience something traumatic.

Instead of dissolving our judgements and generalisations based on our experience, effectively retaining our confidence and self-esteem, we instead assume that life is this horrible and unfair place - which accurately reflect our feelings of hopelessness and fear.

We truly believe that we are inherently worthless and that we deserve to be depressed, rather than isolating our experience as something external and temporary. Soon we can begin to victimise our depression as something necessary and inherent to who we are.

Our superficiality disables and prevents us from discovering meaning in life because our generalisations make us afraid to explore the kind of depth and purpose that we once had in fear of reliving our trauma.

The hardest part is that we also find it incredibly difficult to grasp onto any kind of meaningful solution.

We instead only find the means to develop superficial solutions, such as becoming further obsessed with our ego and our value face judgements, not to mention the self-criticism and addictions that come along with it.

Just like our politicians on the big screen, we become attracted to the story and the identity of the words rather than the outcome of their message.

We continue to obsess over our looks as a means of hope, only to discover that we are perpetually sad and yet we wonder why life just feels so wrong.


### Attachment to our misery.


In our cynicism and superficiality we can begin attributing personality to mental illness and this is a very tragic understanding that I'm sure most people with depression have gone through.

We become so attached to the superficial aspects of our thinking and personality that we can allow it to define us. In this paradigm it becomes incredibly difficult to change the way we think and feel about ourselves.

This comes back down to the egos or identities that we maintain in order to give ourselves significance and self-worth.

It is amazing how we can lose complete control over ourselves by simply neglecting something as simple as perspective. As a wrote earlier, the spark for these kinds of attitudes usually derive from trauma.

I would argue that the cause of our depression and mental illness relates more to how we deal with trauma, rather than the actual trauma itself.

However it is completely understandable that people go through mental illness and depression, just as most people experiencing trauma will.

This article is a lot to take in, however hopefully it provides a nice narrative for you to trace back and understand how you may have developed these mindsets.

Understanding is always the first course of any journey and can allow us to become aware and make fundamental changes in our lives. Mental illness is difficult because we often have no way of tracing back to how we may have developed these mindsets in the first place.

The good news is that no matter what we experience in life, our recovery is the same process of rediscovering confidence and trust, while the importance of developing acceptance in our lives has never been more prominent in the 21st century.
