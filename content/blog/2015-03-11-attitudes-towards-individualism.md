Most of us want to feel special.

We all have developed our own styles, tastes and understandings of the world. When we express ourselves we do it in a way that feels unique to us.

It could be in the way we walk, speak or dress, amongst the millions of different aspects of our personality that make us… well, us. It is an aspect of our personality that we take pride in, as well as potentially shame.

We believe there is no one in the world who is just like us. We spend so long in our own little lives and thoughts in our mind, that we become entirely self-centric in our thoughts and imagination.

Which makes sense, since we only have one consciousness and empathy is an aspect that we find difficult to extend beyond our own physical body.

In fact our obsession with our own individuality extends to the point that it offends us to be associated with anything that is considered ‘common.’ We consider it to be an insult, rather than a blessing.

To be common is to be dull and no one wants to be considered dull or “just like everyone else.” This insecurity stems particularly from the belief that everyone who isn’t us is common.

How else can we possibly feel special about ourselves if this is not the case?


### How we interpret the mainstream.


Perhaps the biggest hurdle that people have in terms of understanding their attitudes towards individualism is in their understanding and ideas of what mainstream is.

The term mainstream is just a description. It is an ideal that is bound by a completely different standard by everyone.

Ironically we believe that anything outside of our current way of thinking is mainstream, when really a majority of our thinking derives from mainstream processes.

In reality most of us are mainstream without knowing it. We are mainstream in all the commonality we have, such as the necessity to eat, feel loved, have an income etc.

To try and deviate ourselves from these common basics and prop our egos up to feel special, we focus on the superficial aspects of life, such as the associations we make with brands and the kinds of fashions that we adopt.

We do this because it allows us to more easily generalise and associate with people who we feel are just as unique and individual as us.

While our expression as people is a direct reflection of our personality, it is no means an honest reflection or assessment of who we are and what we are capable of. This sort of false individuality is harmful because it neglects our core values and principles as human beings.

However, it is not true individuality because it does not allow us to freely exist and express ourselves in lieu of outside pressures. Instead we adopt a form of so-called mainstream individuality, that boxes ourselves into personalities and personas so that we can feel more secure and important about who we are.

Individualism, predicated isolation and misunderstanding is no different to the limitations posed by mainstream or even alternative thought.


### What it means to be individual.


True uniqueness and individuality does not derive from following ideas and notions of what we call “alternative” or even “mainstream".

True individuality comes from critical thought and skepticism – tools which allow us to exercise our strength and judgment as individuals.

Individualism has nothing to do with being different. It has to do with focusing on our values as people, be them common or different, in a way that best expresses our sovereignty.

Alternative thought within itself is just a label and there is nothing individual about using labels to dictate our lives, no matter how colourful or special it makes us feel.

Individualism is about the values and principles that we have as people, which we often neglect in favour for generalised superficiality, which we use in replace for critical thought because we find it easier.

Often people start out as individuals, yet wither into mainstream denominations once their curiosity into themselves ceases.

Without critical thought we have no way of truly gauging who we wish to be as people.


### When we chase labels and not values.


One of the issues with using and chasing labels is that we end up attaching to a bunch of fluctuating ideals in our mind that are constantly fleeting and usually deceptive.

This is due to the way we generalise and distort the language and ideas in our mind.

Because of the duality in the way we think, if we claim to be fat then obviously this means that we cannot be skinny.

Of course, these are just labels for things which completely ignore the connotations of whether being skinny or fat is either healthy or necessarily in our lives.

Instead we simply attach emotions to these labels which allows us to easily generalise and distort who we are, often uncontrollably.

We associate being fat with being sad, guilty and shameful and so we use that as a label to try and motivate us to change using these negative emotions.

While this sounds simple in theory, it is what results in eating disorders, shame eating and a whole number of destructive paths that completely bypass our ability to think critically about our own lives.

We neglect the process in favour of the outcome.


### Throwing away our labels.


At the end of the day when we talk about things such mainstream or alternative, we are merely describing a particular narrative in our minds.

This is part of the reason why I suggest dissolving all ideologies, identities and images in our mind. It allows us the time and energy to think critically about the choices we make in our lives, without trying to manage our emotions to achieve outcomes.

They do not allow perspective freedom of expression. They merely skew and bias our thoughts and feelings.

By learning to become self-aware, we can better understand the way we truly think and resultantly, regain control of who we are.
