Depression can make us feel dead on the inside.

It can make us feel as if we have lost all purpose and motivation in life, to the point of complete emotional apathy.

Some people describe it as a hollow tingle that embraces the body, a feeling of welcome and calm to the apparent chaos in our lives.

It is an antithesis to the guilt and anxiety we have come to familiarise ourselves with on a daily basis, like an inherent lack of expectation or tension.

It can feel serene to no longer have to deal with the constant riddle of guilt or shame that we feel about ourselves on a daily basis and there can be a whole number of different reasons and causes for reaching emotional apathy.

In a lot of cases we can simply feel exhausted or self-defeated by our own mental health to the point that we give up under the pressure and complexity of our problems.

In many ways we can view emotional apathy as an alternative to having to deal with our problems rather than dealing with them, as a way switching off and embracing what little function we have left.

The primary issue is that even if we can relieve some of emotional suffering, emotional apathy is not a complete solution because at some point we will have to deal with the reality of our situation.

The biggest question is how. Is there even a way to properly process our feelings? Will I always be stuck within my rut?

To answer these questions we need to take a closer look at why we fall into apathy in the first place.


### Why apathy is not an effective form of resolution.


Emotional apathy can feel like a sufficient resolution in our minds.

To suddenly feel free of the rumination and guilt in our minds can seem like an eternally beautiful thing.

It can make us feel as if we have accepted and come to terms with our circumstances, if not temporarily.

The problem with emotional apathy is that it forms one part of the cycle of depression. When we exhaust ourselves from our feelings of depression, we merely reset the cycle if we do not address the underlying cause of our depression.

This is because we go through the same thinking patterns, same self-defeating beliefs and we merely set ourselves up to reach a point of mania followed by emotional apathy.

In many ways this is the cockiness that people have with their depression, where they feel as if they have been set free when days later they fall back down into the same negative thinking patterns.

Furthermore, shutting down can become a learned behaviour as one of the only ways we can know how to cope with our mental issues.

This functions in the same way as when we use drugs or emotional eating to calm ourselves from our issues - we become dependant on these things, rather than healthier or non-consequential alternatives.

Another reason why emotional apathy is problematic is because it is not truly calming in the same way meditation.

This is because emotional apathy does not attempt to be mindful or even empathetic - the kinds of introspective qualities we need bring ourselves closer to our problems. This is obvious if we look at how we achieve apathy. Truly calming states of mind are usually cultivated, while apathy is generally provoked through exhaustion or excessive trauma.

It is in this sense that apathy is draining rather than therapeutic.

In addition for apathy to be effective it needs to be reinforced in our minds through self-defeating thought patterns.

To feel apathy, a very heavy state of mind, requires that we constantly focus on this image of « the void » growing inside of us as a way of giving it power. Otherwise apathy is not self-sustaining and we return back to our anxiety or manic depression.

Based on these observations apathy is not so much an absence as it is an attachment to an ideal and once we do become attached to this ideal, it can be difficult to establish clarity or look at other healthier alternatives to this state of mind.


### Overcoming apathy.


There are many different things that we can do to absolve our apathy and a large part of the that is questioning our habits and behaviours in life.

Before we can change our habits, we need to begin asking the right questions in life so that we can expose alternatives to our apathy and depression.

Asking questions is important because it gives us focus in our aspirations for recovery.

We need to question the importance of happiness in our lives. We need to question how we can do things differently and particularly, questioning the role of cynicism in our lives.

While at first these questions may seem pointless, in the long run that actually start to build a sense of curiosity over our mental illness. Even if we do not know the answers and quite likely we will not for a long while, it still points us in the right direction of developing open minds which can point us towards solutions and points of view which we may not have considered before.

Our cynicism is often the direct cause of why our curiosity for potential remains hamper and so often that is a good place to start questioning.

It is also okay to admit that we know little about why we feel negative all the time and display neurotic behaviours.

Our mental health is a slow work in progress and it takes a lot of time and trial and error before we do inevitably discover these answers for ourself.

Understandably our situation may seem hopeless, however only if we ask the wrong questions. Self-defeating questions will lead to self-defeating answers and so it comes down to discovering the right perspectives to fit our circumstances.

These are all things which come with time and experience.

To truly address our apathy or cycle of depression, requires a wide range of perspectives and I certainly recommend reading other articles to get a better understanding of the holistic function of depression.

Depression is not a one-size-fits-all solution and while we often cannot change the past, that does not mean we do not have the power to move on and prevent further emotional suffering.

It can certainly be accomplished no matter how hard we fall.
