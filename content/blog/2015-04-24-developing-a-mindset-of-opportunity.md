Sometimes we can get lost among our thoughts and feelings.

Our lives can become a of soup of mixed emotions that takes us away from focusing on possibility. When we feel sad, we allow the sadness to engulf us. When we feel happy, we ride our happiness with the expectation that it may not last forever.

We put so much faith into how our fluctuating emotions have treated us in the past that we consolidate our mental illness into something fixed within our lives.

In the process we begin to see the world in terms of our mental illness, rather than who we truly want to be.

Even if we know deep down inside that we want to be happy and productive, as long as we look at the world through the lens of our mental illness we will always limit ourselves to our perceived incapacities, rather than our true capacity as human beings.

In other words, we fail to think critically about our mental illness and how we can effectively take control over it. We simply drift with our emotions and then we beg mercy when they cause us to suffer.

We feel so hopeless within ourselves that we do not even realise we have the ability to create standards for what is possible in our lives.

To change this mindset, we need to think more deeply about our own actions and how we are independent from our own thoughts and emotions.


### Embracing an attitude of change.


One thing people rarely think of are the choices available in their lives.

When we remain within a jaded mindset, our point of view can trap us and stop us to think outside of the box where possibility for hope lies.

We merely become drones to the self-defeating narrative that we play in our minds on a daily basis, doing nothing to question or challenge the assumptions we make in our head.

One way to create hope is by opening up choices for ourselves.

Even though we are literally surrounded by choice and opportunity in our lives, when we latch onto these self-defeating narratives we merely feed our depression with lies that give it power.

This effect is amplified when there are multiple narratives- a narrative that we are not good enough, a narrative that we are hopeless, etc.

When we create these options for ourselves, it gives us opportunities and possibilities beyond our current flawed understanding of life. We do this by thinking and dreaming big because this will form the basis for optimism to flourish so we can overcome and change the narratives in our mind.

You need to ask yourself important questions like if you would like to be the kind of person that doesn't suffer from depression. Should happiness be something that we experience on a daily basis?

We need to start asking questions that are in line with our goals and ambitions, rather than in line with the narrative in our minds.

We need to use perspective to create choice and options in our lives.


### Why hope is vital for our recovery.


Many people claim that hope is bogus, however there is a fatal error in this logic.

People who assume that hope is false are the same people who also believe that their emotions are deeply personal.

The biggest issue that people suffering from mental illness have is that they take their emotions too personally, when our emotions merely exist as a way to convey signals to our mind.

Hope is not personal, much in the same way that happiness is a feeling that we can evoke through the way we think.

Our emotions can give the impression of appearing personal because of the way they make us feel and the associations we create relative to them, however on the whole our emotions exist to serve us, rather than dictate how we should live our lives.

Though, only if we choose so.

The fact that our thoughts can override our emotions suggests that there is a higher level of control in our ability to act, rather remain complacent to what we feel.

Hope is one of the most important feelings we can have. It gives life reason to exist and project itself.

Without hope there is no outcome and when we become stuck within a jaded and depressed mindset, in addition to taking our emotions personally, we can overlook all the true choice and opportunity that we have in our lives.


### Creating options in our life.


When we feel hopeful about life and when we options and opportunity to pursue, we can feel entirely unstoppable.

As long as there is life there will always be opportunity and in most cases the reason why we cannot see opportunity is not because we are truly helpless, but because we are so depressed that we cannot quite see it.

This is most prevalent in those who have the whole world ahead of them (especially today's youth) but feel depressed about their own lives, which is a large majority of those living in developed countries.

In a lot of cases, we can be so surrounded by abundance that it has the effect of crushing us into feeling inadequate. Through perspective and self-awareness, we can overcome these limiting beliefs and make real, positive changes in our life.
