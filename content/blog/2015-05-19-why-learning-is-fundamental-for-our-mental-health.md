Many of us lack the skills required to learn effectively.

As absurd as it sounds, if we were truly taught to embrace learning a philosophy in our lives, mental illness would not be as pervasive in society as it is today.

Our education system does not teach us how to learn. Instead, it teaches us that facts are to be accepted as truth, rather than discovered and explored as knowledge should be.

Instead of thinking for ourselves, we instead abide by a system of authority and subservience to knowledge.

This kind of learning leaves us detached and dispassionate towards what we have absorbed and does not promote us to grow as individuals.

We are told that life is so complex and vast that we need people to think for us, when in reality we all have the power and potential to think for ourselves. So we have so-called ‘experts’ that understand the world inside and out.

Instead of reflecting on our actions and taking responsibility in our lives, we simply accept our circumstances for what they are.

We assume that others will take our responsibility for us. We expect that a bunch of experts will have the answer and it is in this way that we allow ourselves to be endlessly abused. Furthermore when we do not think for ourselves, we are easily taken advantage of, even if it is unintentional and with good intention.

The moment someone is branded an ‘expert’ everything they say is considered official truth, no matter how damaging or incorrect they might be. Even if they are wrong, it simply means that our woes and misfortunates are a result of their mistakes, rather than our own.

We breed a culture of blame-seeking and disempowerment, where self-limiting beliefs are considered normal because of the illusion of complexity that is professed onto us. We stick with our mental illnesses as truth, rather than something which is to be discovered or explored.

Instead of questioning the way we feel through our own curiosity and through our desire to learn, we instead become dependent on the medication and false opinions that have come to encircle society.


### What is effective learning about?


Effective learning is about the curiosity to discover and explore in our lives. It is a process of discovering of how we can create meaning and fun from the world. When we are actively or even subconsciously learning, we are discovering new and amazing things about the world and of ourselves everyday.

Of course there are many different ways to learn. It is also possible to learn dispassionately which is how most of us feel towards education.

Our mindsets towards education often define how we also feel about life.

If we embrace learning, it means that we embrace our circumstances and adapt to new and different ways of thinking. If we reject learning then it merely means that we have come to reject our own lives along with understanding how they function.

It is in this sense that passion makes life seem easy.

The good news is that it is a passion that we all have within us. The bad news is that our current education system does not promote this sort of passion, which we will take a further look into.


### The role of education in our lives.


It is important to take a look at the way we value education in our lives, because quite naturally, learning is an extension of this ideal. It begs to ask how passionate you are about learning.

If you were to start learning how to play the bassoon, how passionate do you think you would be at learning it? Do you think you would be effective at it?

People who are effective at learning love to learn just about anything and this is because effective learners are unconditional about their passion for learning.

They love to learn anything because they understand that learning is a basic technique and approach towards life, which is easily broken down, rather than something which we must force ourselves to enjoy.

Furthermore, they enjoy learning because it makes them feel good, which relates to developing a positive self-esteem to the things that we find creative and productive.

A lot of our issues come down to our system of education that fails to develop this sense of curiosity and technique within us. Instead, our education system provides us with the facts and expects us to memorise them without going into detail why or even how to do it with passion.

Most of us reverse to very perverse incentives, such as money rewards or even the opportunity to do something other than learn like play video games!


### The philosophy of education.


With this kind of behaviour we merely train ourselves to avoid our problems, rather than embrace them and address them with pride.

It is also part of the reason why so many children are so discontent with learning and hate school. We are not taught in a way that embraces learning, but instead trains us to reach a certain standard of understanding of the world.

One place we can start is to change the way we see education and learning.

It should be viewed as a philosophy towards life, rather than a merely skill of standard of knowledge. If we embrace the philosophy of learning, then our challenges no longer seem so unbearable.

Mental illness no longer seems so difficult because we have the curiosity to explore and discover solutions to our woes. When we neglect education we effectively neglect ourselves and the tragic thing is that most people do not realise this.


### The importance of ambition.


Recovery is literally about learning to change and adapt to the challenges in our life – which is precisely what effective learning is about.

Ambition is important for our recovery because teaches us to embrace the learning process so we can overcome our problems. To have great ambitions in life is to fully embrace the process of learning in our lives, which obviously promotes change and discovery. Not to mention, the kind of positive self-esteem which promotes feeling good about ourselves.

At the end of the day it all comes down to mastering who we are and without a knack for learning, we cannot hope to be effective in any matter.

Learning and education is the foundation for which we come to construct every single aspect of our lives, so by embracing and perfecting these processes we can truly give ourselves the opportunity to overcome our mental illnesses.
