Some of us have an ideal version of who we should be in our minds.

This ideal version of ourselves is not a true reflection of who we are, but who we think we should be in our minds. Our existence is entirely irrespective of our thoughts of who we should be.

This ideal version of ourselves is naturally smarter, prettier, more capable and almost better than who we are in every way. It is what we use to motivate and encourage us to become these things.

It is not who we are today but who we aspire to become tomorrow. We believe that by idealising these traits into an identity and attaching to this identity in our mind, that we can most effectively influence we are.

We do it so we can achieve these ideals.

We believe that the more faith we put into this image and identity, the more we attach and really believe in this ideal self, that the quicker and more effective we can become at becoming them.

Unfortunately this is a faulty and dangerous way of thinking that instead of helping people improve their lives with ease, drives them into depression, paralysing self-criticism and prominently self-delusion.

Many of us end up spending years, decades and even the rest of our lives fighting this identity and consequences ourselves.

It's Even more dangerous when we create ideal identities and version of other people that we attach to.


### When we shatter our identity.


When our identity manages to fit in with our actions, then we actually feel good about ourselves. We truly feel like we are on the path to becoming our image!

Our identities manage to inspire us while we are able to maintain it.

Things start to fall apart however once our ambitions are hindered. The issue is that our identities are only able to be effective if we are maintaining them with our actions.

If our actions are disrupted, perhaps if we miss one workout session or we are unable to pursue the persona of our identity, then we instantly feel like failures. We fail our identity and this naturally results in doubt, guilt, shame as well as a whole range of negative emotions.

There is no possible alternative to our identity, because it is perfection in our minds. Who could possibly reject perfection?

To compensate for this we decide to criticise ourselves so that we can reinforce our identity of perfection. We believe that if we scold ourselves, as we were when we were children, then we can make up for our feelings of guilt and shame.

Humans have this ugly duality for success and failure. In the process we fail to see life from a holistic point of view, where the path to success is riddled with failure.

Unfortunately perfectionism does not allow for this kind of leniency. So we continue along our merry way… until we fail our identity again and fall back into self-doubt and guilt.

Over time we end up repeating these same cycles of self-criticism, weakening ourselves emotionally each time. This cause us to break our image more often as we slowly erode the hope for who we want to become.

The self-criticism eventually becomes so constant that we end up feeling guilty and negative all of the time.

Our emotions have gotten the better of us and we are left completely clueless as to how we got here. All we know is that we feel terrible and we end up equating this to our goals.

We blame our goals and we abandon our dreams. We come to the conclusion that our goals were too hard and unobtainable – even toxic for our self-development.

The act of giving up makes you feel even worse about yourself and the vicious cycle grows within you.

Knowing that you can never be your identity (not to mention how far behind you are because of the all the time spent in self-doubt) constantly plagues you with shame and regret.

It paralyses you to know that you will never be perfect in your own mind.

We spend so much time arguing with this logic and self-worthlessness in our mind that we abandon pursing our ambitions altogether. We spend so much time fighting the self-criticism and worthlessness that we simply do not have the time, nor the energy.

As you can imagine this is a horrible way to experience life and strive for our goals.

Alternatively we can successfully achieve our goals by being self-aware and embracing our potential, rather than focusing on our limitations defined by what we believe is the best version of ourselves in our mind.


### The problem with identity.


The primary problem with identity is that it is entirely inflexible and unrealistic.

It is an unrealistic expectation of who we should be, because we can never hope to be the image of who we should be in our mind. We generalise and selectively distort who we should be in our minds.

This is why people form eating habits or insecurities about the way they look, because they feel like they are never enough. They do not truly accept who they are and what they are capable of.

Without accepting who we are, we cannot hope to develop a sense of responsibility and learn to change who we are in an effective manner that does not require manipulating our emotions and identities of who we should be.

Instead we can create raw initiative using solid logic, hard work and raw motivation – simply because we want it.


### Moving on from our identity.


The alternative is to live in the moment, where we pay attention to our actions and emotions, rather than our ideas of the future.

An alternative way of thinking where we use our focus create motivation and pursue our life purpose. A way of thinking that does not rely on developing an identity to hide behind.

This can be very difficult for people to do because many of us have been creating identities in our mind since birth. We may still truly believe that these identities are who we truly are and some of us will spend the rest of our lives defending and fighting them.

These identities were constructed long ago with the foresight that they would be beneficial and protect us, usually from our prior traumas.

Unfortunately they end up creating more complications than they manage to solve.

I have written various articles on how to dissolve our identities, but I hope this article gives a good overview on how our identities can construe our lives and create emotional pain through perfectionism.
