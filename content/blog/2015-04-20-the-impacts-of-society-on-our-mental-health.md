It is as if neurotic has become the new normal.

We either feel too unmotivated or too ambitious or too anxious or too confident or too purposeless or too smart for our own good and possibly even too drunk to care.

No other species on this planet is as deceptive, morally corrupt or as dysfunctional as the human race has become, especially considering how radically our circumstances have changed over the past 10,000 years.

The exorbitant pressures that are placed upon us are staggering.

We are expected to labour continuously for 8 hours a day or more as one of the only viable ways to survival in today's society and the daily responsibilities of living have resulted in more addictions and mental disorders than ever before.

As a result, our neurotic behaviour is not only to be expected, however it is something society has come to exaggerate.

Our dysfunction has become such a cultural phenomenon that it is wholly reflected in the popular culture we consume on a daily basis. Reality television featuring highly dysfunctional individuals is considered prime entertainment and the celebrities we  idolise and worship are no better.

Of course, this does not mean that we are helpless to the impact society has on our lives. We may be at a grave disadvantage, however thankfully we have all the tools and skills necessary to prevent society from completely taking over our lives.


### Defining purposes.


Very are rarely encouraged to contemplate and question the meaning of life.

Instead society provides us this meaning through the narratives that are stories that are constantly drilled into our minds on a daily basis. Thinking for ourselves is simply not conducive to the agenda society sets for us.

The narrative is the story that we play in our minds to guide us and give us purpose to the tasks that we complete on a daily basis. It keeps us logically and emotionally consistent with our the expectations that are sought of us.

If our job is to sell a product or to build roads, our entire purpose comes down to making sales and assisting in the building of infrastructure. It becomes the essence of what we do and represents in life and it molds into our ego as a way to identify who we are.

It can also cause us to become stuck within this mindset. We become so absorbed into these tasks that we cannot objectively view what we really want in our lives and live unaware of our true purpose in life. In fact, many of us simply go to our jobs for decades without truly enjoying or even knowing why it is we work these jobs.

When we do not question these narratives, we trap ourselves into a victim mindset and we learn to become victims of circumstance, rather than creators of circumstance.

When our work becomes too much for us to handle or appreciate, we become smokers or we medicate our feelings with drugs and alcohol. Some people choose to admit that they are perpetually miserable during the week and that their only source of happiness arrives during the weekend where they can forget about their menial tasks.

We develop aggressive and judgmental attitudes towards the people we love and we even lose touch with who we are. We become lethargic and helpless, maybe even depressed.

We do absolutely anything but take effective action over our lives because we feel victim to our own circumstances.

This is why it is important to question the narratives and stories that we play in our mind, otherwise we risk become miserable and complacent. Many people simply live unaware until they realise that they have worked endless for decades at a job that never once inspired them to be happy.


### Keeping in touch with who we are.


Incomes are invariably necessary and while there are a lot of responsibilities that we simply cannot avoid, this does not mean we have to live in misery and without purpose. If we can define our values in our life that truly important to us, such as our own happiness and well-being, then we can break out of these limiting and victim mindsets which hold us down.

Our values are important because they encircle our visions for the future of who we want to become, which is where our purpose lies.

To help expose these mindsets, it is useful to acknowledge all the expectations that society has over ourselves and how they affect the way we feel.

The narratives we are exposed to are numerous from the magazines we read to the very TV shows we absorb ourselves in, however most prominently it is the opinions of our peers that influence us the most.

It could be the ideas of wearing certain brands to be accustomed to fashion or the idea that having children should dictates our value and self-worth as people.

This is why it is particularly helpful to focus on the things that we are most insecure about because our insecurities are usually a reflection of the standards of society which are projected onto us, rather than a reflection of our individual values.

It is only when unquestionably believe these narratives that we allow ourselves to become easily manipulated and forced into positions and understanding that do not flow with what is truly important in our lives.


### Dissolving the narratives of society.


Many people will make the argument that they do not follow anyone else's standards and that they are purely individual.

Presumptuously there is absolutely nothing wrong with following anyone else's standards and neither does it matter if your standards are your own. It is about focusing on what makes you happy and healthy in your own life.

In a lot of cases however, people remain in denial with themselves as a way to cope with their circumstances and this is a product of the validation of neurotic behaviour through the overriding narratives of society.

There is this narrative that is it okay to excessively consume more and more, amongst the millions of other narratives that are counter-productive to the goals we may have in life. Furthermore, most of these narratives are designed to profit and benefit those who have created them at the expense of others.

While there is safety in predetermined narratives, it also leaves us vulnerable to the dangers that false expectations and unwanted consequences can create in our lives. We can romanticise consumption and feel euphoria of retail therapy, however if it means that we are constantly broke, is this a true measure of prosperity?

We need to start asking what is truly important to us. We need to start creating our own narratives and dictating our own lives through honest and positive narratives.

When we allow ourselves to become victims of circumstance, we deny ourselves the opportunity to truly embrace our ambitions and dreams.

In fact, we give up our dreams and ambitions in favour of other people’s dreams and then we wonder we end up feeling empty and insecure or unfulfilled at work, even if we pursue these narratives well and exceed at our jobs.

By become aware of these thoughts and behaviours, we can change the narrative in our head and consequently, change who we are for the better.
