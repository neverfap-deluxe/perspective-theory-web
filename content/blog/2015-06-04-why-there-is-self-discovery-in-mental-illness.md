**Overview:** In gaining perspective we can come to understand mental illness as something ‘bad’ or ‘evil.’ This understanding hinders our interpretation of what mental illness is and how best to approach it. In this article I explore how delusion manifests, why it is largely natural and how we can use these understandings to better aid our quest for self-discovery.

The purpose of this blog is to help us overcome our mental illness through perspective and self-awareness.

In describing mental illness and it’s hindrance towards our lives, my words more often than not paint a negative and biased picture of what mental illness and delusion is.

While the aim of this blog is to help us overcome mental illness I do not believe that it is constructive in the long run to view mental illness as something necessarily evil or bad.

I believe this interpretation merely distorts our ability to view our own mental illness effectively and constructively, even distorting the place that mental illness has in our lives.

I decided to write this article because while mental illness is obviously a horrible thing to experience, it can be helpful to have a more meaningful understanding and appreciation of what it means to have mental illness rather than a complete rejection of this aspect of our personality.

In many ways I believe that self-awareness and delusion are largely two sides of the same coin – both inherent processes of this experience we call life.

While self-awareness is a wonderful way of experiencing the world this should certainly not be a reflection of the qualities of delusion or denial as far as life is concerned.

In fact most of us have spent a vast majority of our lives in denial and is arguably responsible for our discovery of self-awareness.

I do not believe that denial or mental illness is inherently wrong because of how it makes us feel and think about the world.

It helps instead to think of mental illness as a path being taken in life often against or oblivious to our intentions as individuals.

Whether in states of denial or self-awareness, life and recovery are largely the same thing and should be treated as a learning process.

Hating or becoming frustrated of our mental illness and dysfunction is understandable, however in the limited relief that this anger provides our negative reactions are not the equivalent or resolve of self-discovery.

Experiencing depression and mental illness is a condition of life rather than a benign and unfortunate disease. In many cases, this dysfunction can be incredibly fortunate and insightful depending on how we face and overcome these challenges.

It is also important to understand that this website is primarily targeted at those who want to transition beyond their mental illness. I am sure there are many other subcultures which aim to do the opposite and that is fine too.


### How we experience delusion in our lives.


Delusion is a largely natural reaction to the world.

It can help to think of delusion as an exaggerated or distorted sense of feeling, interpretation and understanding of the world. It is often thought of as a response to our insecurity or desire in life.

On a roller coaster ride it is typical to experience a heightened state of fear or euphoria which is seemingly irrational in retrospect. Even though we are completely safe in the harness and construction of the ride, we can feel so impressionable to our environment that it may feel as if we are going to fall out of the ride and die.

This kind of irrationality is not necessarily delusion per say however it demonstrates one aspect of how mental illness can form.

If these feelings and thoughts continue to traumatise individuals long after their experience has surpassed then it is possible for mental illness to form.

In another example imagine how you would feel if you had won the lottery today.

You would most likely become overwhelmed with joy and delusions of grandeur, perhaps even believing in some kind of manifest destiny. After all, how often is it that people win the lottery?

When we experience something as profound or as amazing as winning the lottery, it is typical to give our feelings a heightened sense of power of significance. In other words construct an ego or identity from these emotions and tie them to our self-worth.

When you think about it a little more closely however, very little actually changes in our lives when we experience these kinds of events, especially if they are sentimental by nature.

We still have our lungs to breathe with and our requirement to intake oxygen remains unchanged. We still have the same desire to eat and feel loved and our immutable IQ remains no different.

Our capacity to experience happiness and sadness also remains unchanged and what be more important that having effective control over your emotions?

Even in the initial rush of our experience our emotions always effectively baseline regardless of our outcome, even in the case of becoming paraplegic or the future president of Rwanda.

Yet because of how our delusion plays into our ego and identity we actually feel as if we are smarter, improved or more functional than we were before.

Our ego and identity distorts the way in which we perceive reality - creating the prime opportunity for future mental illness.

Instead of having a broad appreciation for life we instead place unreasonable conditions and expectations on how we must experience the world.

We create these conditions as a way of maintaining our ego which essentially reinforces self-limiting points of view based on what we feel we deserve to feel, rather than what we are capable of feeling.

It is in this sense that we create our conditions for happiness, much in the  same way that we create our conditions for misery.

Many rich people are unhappy with their lives because money only provides a temporary boosts of dopamine and status that quickly baselines.

Rather than develop a true state of unconditional happiness people will instead chase addictive mechanisms based in lust and pleasure.

Remember what I said earlier about people being impressionable to their environment? What this really means is that we tend to take our life experiences quite personally to the point of truly believing that they are real.

It is through this mechanism that we truly believe we are gods or that we are worthless as people. The ego is a truly incredible thing.

This is why one very fundamental skill of overcoming our mental illness is learning not to take things personally and it is something I discuss in greater detail in other articles.

Delusion is a process of life that we all experience however it is also from these experience that learn to mature and grow into adults.

Subsequently it is also through these experiences that we remain immature, irrational and develop mental illness if we do not learn to process delusion effectively.


### Understanding self-discovery.


As impressionable beings delusion and mental illness can be entirely unavoidable and it is why some individuals can remain completely dysfunctional for so long.

We cannot predict the future along with all the horrible and amazing things that will happen to us in the coming years.

Cynics take the view that we are hopeless to these events and that we should just give up or accept that the world is a horrible place, however I believe it simply highlights the importance of developing self-awareness and perspective related skills.

Not only are they tools to protect us when things go south however it also makes us more appreciative of reality when things go well.

It is in this sense that self-awareness and perspective are tools of life rather than tools specifically aimed at addressing mental illness.

It can help to start by thinking about the kinds of experiences that we do want in life all the way down to the people we interact with the kinds of foods we eat on a daily basis.

It is also crucial to understand that self-awareness and delusion are not penultimate life goals – they merely serve as a consequence to the way in which we live our lives.

The fact is that there are many different ways to discover ourselves and experience life and it is a conscious decision that you must personally make.

Ultimately it always comes back down to the way we learn and interact with the world and personally speaking, all my experiences in life have provided me with invaluable perspective of what self-discovery means to me.
