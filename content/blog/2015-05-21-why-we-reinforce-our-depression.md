Depression has a habit of distorting our perception of reality.

Many people view depression as an almost natural state of mind, as if we are either born depressed or happy by design.

Our depression can mould and shape our perception of the world away from what it actually is, particularly if we have remained depressed for a long period of time.

With this distortion we fail to truly understand what depression is, as well as how it can be absolved from our lives.

From my own experience and that of others, I tend to take the view that depression is something which is not naturally self-sustaining. This is, to suggest that we tend to self-reinforce our depression beyond which it hopes to exist.

Depression is an excessive state of mind that is tense and full of conflict and this kind of tension requires a lot of effort and force to maintain. We have to religiously impose upon ourselves a level of guilt, shame and self-criticism that often exhausts us into boredom.

In fact, that is part of the reason why we tend to exhaust ourselves with our anxiety or depression, so that we can eventually become bored of the feeling and move on.

For others though who so avidly believe that they are worthy of guilt and shame, exhaustion can sometimes have no effect on the beliefs that they have of themselves.

Instead we merely transpired into even more guilt and sadness to the point of emotional apathy.

Through a range of different perspectives and understandings, we can better understand how our depression functions so we can limit the influence that it has in our life.


### Reinforcing the self-defeating narrative.


Our beliefs are the primary culprit of our depression and they can go a long way in causing us to diverge from reality. If we truly believe that we are deserving of guilt and that we are helpless as individuals, then these attitudes will exist entirely in our expectations and capabilities as people.

It is through our beliefs that we self-impose these limitations of perception onto us.

They are limitations of perception because they ignore our capacity as human beings. They ignore our arms and legs which are just as capable as anyone else’s and our brain which is capable of learning the exact same things as anyone else.

Yet interestingly enough, these beliefs usually begin to change once they become overly inconvenient for us.

While the emotional pain is mild we actually do not mind the self-defeating attitudes. In many ways they actually feel comforting and reconfirming, as they are very much self-fulfilling prophecies as I mentioned earlier with the change in expectation we have of ourselves.

It is only once the pain becomes too vast and complex do we find the initiative to want to change. We have a moment of realisation to the pointless of our emotional pain, no matter how much we believe we deserve it.

Of course, many people resort to thinking that they do not believe enough, which can result in guilt or a reinforcement of the process.

To promote our beliefs we will create intricate networks of beliefs that literally trap our guilt and self-hatred at every corner.

The only way we can possibly do this is back our beliefs with false assumptions about who we are and who we should be, which also makes them fundamentally weak at the same time.

We live in our emotional and logical glass house which makes us emotionally unstable, as if we will do absolutely everything in our power to prevent ourselves from becoming empowered, which proves to be increasingly difficult the more complex our faulty beliefs become.

In many cases it can result in a mental break down or a state of emotional apathy where our beliefs and thought have become so complex and illogical that we simply give up on trying.

This represents one of the many basic cycles of depression and why people can experience the emotional lows and highs of being neurotic.

Thankfully there is an easier, more effective way of living our lives that does not rely on manipulating and managing ourselves on a constant basis. The alternative is to live in the present moment where we can choose how we want to feel about ourselves.


### Depression dissolves naturally.


Large amounts of tension are not designed to hold itself together. It naturally dissipates and deteriorates on it’s own.

Think of how water holds itself through tension.

When you empty an entire bucket of water from a building, the water does not hold together into one tight ball and stay together.

The water chaotically goes everywhere. From a natural point of view, it is physically and chemically impossible to hold that kind of tension together without manipulating the gravity and air pressure from making it all fall apart.

Instead of letting our depression dissipate so that we can experience some form of peace in our lives, we do everything in our power to reinforce it and keep it together.

Like a sand castle we have constructed of our beliefs, nature is slowly eroding the castle through the wind.

Instead of allowing it to disappear, we reinforce the castle by making it even bigger to the point where micromanaging this sand castle becomes too complex and time consuming to the point that it all falls apart.

Of course, the sand castle is not important. It is the belief that we must keep this sand castle alive that drives us insane.

Sometimes our depression can become so habitual and obsessive that we don’t even truly know why we feel the way we do or why we bother. Asking the right questions, questions that are critical of our actions, is often a good first step towards overcoming our problems.


### The solution is right in front of us.


While depression is largely circumstantial in our lives, it merely becomes fabricated and sustained up until a certain point.

It is natural to feel sadness or grief if we experience particularly harsh or devastating events in our life, however holding onto these feelings is what causes us to experience pain beyond reproach.

Meditation practices can work wonders to keep our mind calm and from rumination, which is a direct way of changing our neural tendency to think excessively.

While embracing calm can help, it can usually be more helpful to actually change and address our beliefs directly. This means addressing all the faulty beliefs and false assumptions that we have maintained about ourselves.

Though really, we must question the role of depression in our lives and why we feel depressed in the first place.

Without having the courage to question the assumptions of our thoughts and actions, we cannot ever hope to change any aspect of our lives.
