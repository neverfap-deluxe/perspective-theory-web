Hope is what gives purpose to our dreams and aspirations. It is an ideal which consigns direction to our future potential. It can be used to help enlighten and subdue the fear and rejection life sometimes imposes on us. It is a healthy way of coping.

With this same framework in mind, I also believe that a lot of people have come to misunderstand what hope is, as well as it's intentions and what it's capable of. Some people have this idea that hope is a lie designed to keep you in a state of delusion, that it's this pointless chase towards something which cannot be obtained.

I personally held these views in the past, but have now come to understand that hope is just a tool that can either be used correctly or harmfully to produce either positive or negative results. Ultimately it helps to look at hope as a skill, rather than a personality trait, which can be used however we like to enhance in own our lives.

### What is good hope?


It's important to understand that hope is merely a direction. Without hope, we have no direction. With hope, we at least have a direction in mind as to where we want to be, even if we may not know how to get there yet. Hope itself is not an answer, but a way helping us find the answer.

Good hope, the sort of hope which helps us achieve our goals and doesn't lead to false expectation, has one very fundamental aspect which gives it power: substance. Bad hope has either no substance or a false sense of substance.

For example, if we hope to lose weight without doing anything about it, then essentially we're putting too much faith into our hope for action or this sort of "false substance," versus the action of actually losing weight. Eventually, we end up blaming our hope, or our sense of direction, rather than the underlying factors which hope itself cannot provide.

It begs to say that purpose very rarely stands on its own. Achieving our goals requires dedication, a sense of work ethic, as well as a large number of structural pressures to bring it all together.

Once people consistently experience the false walls of expectation that bad hope has sought to provide, then naturally we become jaded about achieving ever our dreams or even basic, daily goals. This is a terrible logical fallacy which results in misunderstanding ourselves and what we're capable of.


### How do we give hope substance?


While ideas are a most brilliant thing, they're entirely conceptual and thus potentially illogical until they've been physically realised and applied to our lives. It's one thing to imagine a car the size of a moon, but is it physically possible to sustain such a structure on earth? Would gravity even allow such a structure to maintain it's form?

Likewise, we all have these amazing ideas in our mind which stand like beacons of light to our existence. It's part of being human, to dream and aspire towards things greater than ourselves.

However, we simply won't know if these dreams are possible until we test them by following them up with our actions. We can do this through trial and error, improvising on past knowledge or following the steps of someone wiser than us.

What this means is that in order to give our hope substance, we must have a process in order to describe our actions.


<blockquote>_Hope + Process + Action = How we achieve our goals._</blockquote>


Hope gives us direction, while our process details our actions. Hope drives our actions and in return, gives our hope substance. This is a healthy and sustainable way to achieve our goals.


### The danger of misusing hope.


Bad hope is when we over or under-think the process behind our actions. Instead, we put so much faith into our hope, rather than the underlying process involved of organising our actions, that we confuse hope itself for our dreams and then blame our dreams for our failures.

By relying solely on hope to steer us through life, we essentially become attached to the ideas and dreams in our heads, rather than the actual reality of seeing these dreams come to life. We become so attached to our dreams that hope itself becomes the process of our actions. It is a horrible aspect of delusion.

Our dreams and desires then become unhealthy obsessions, rather than something which can be used to inspire us and insight us to become better people. It is in these moments that hope becomes this tyrannous authority in our lives, rather than a helpful guide towards salvation. Hope then becomes a way for us to reject responsibility, rather than empower us through action.

In essence, bad hope is a result of bad policy and a misunderstanding of the way hope works in conjunction with processes and actions required to produce influential results. Good hope on the other hand, is a balance of all that is required to help us regulate our hope and actions, so that we can work in harmony with our thoughts to achieve our goals.

This is why learning the art of good hope is necessary if we're ever to realise our full potential as human beings.
