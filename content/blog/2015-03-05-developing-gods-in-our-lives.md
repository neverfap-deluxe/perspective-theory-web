We are all inherently religious by definition.

Wikipedia defines religion as an organized collection of beliefs, cultural systems, and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence.

Some atheists are more religious in their beliefs that those of from other mainstream denominations like Christianity or Islam. While Atheism is in some ways more rational this does not mean that Atheism or any other religion is any more truthful.

Truth is an entirely individual aspect of our personality which may be predicated upon honest or dishonest. It is purely subjective.

The problem with people who claim to be non-religious is that they fail to understand what religion or god is. They forget that everything in our lives relate to religion in some way, be it in our beliefs or understanding of the world.

Therefore it is important for us to understand how religion and god works, otherwise we end up subconsciously creating gods out of certain ideas and even people and inanimate objects without knowing it.


### What are gods?


It's important to note that those who are usually most jaded about religion, are those who have not experienced the intensity of religious ideas in their lives.

This does not make them any less religious, simply unaware of their circumstances.

It could be through their relationship with god or even their partner or friends. People who have never experienced love or intense feelings of euphoria attached to an idea, be it in romance or salvation.

Without feeling the power of our ideas we cannot truly appreciate the extent to which they exist.

Part of the reason why we develop gods is because of these feelings. When an idea or identity injects us with so much hope and euphoria, we can easily develop these ideas into permanent structures within our minds.

These structures become so strong that they form what we call gods in our mind.

Gods are structures of total truth in our mind. We cannot see beyond our gods because we believe them to be true, perfect and complete. Naturally this can cause us to disassociate with reality.

Of course, we don't know the difference because god is something we feel and when we feel god so strongly, then obviously it must be truth.

In a sense our parents try to teach us to accept them as gods in our mind. They do it to give themselves power, control and authority over who we are.

Of course this naturally breaks down once we realise how infalliable they truly are. We realise that they are not true, perfect and complete, and so we rebel to establish our own beliefs of the truth, perhaps contrary to what is best for us.

Why? Because we are driven by emotion. We do not like the feeling when they shout at us and tell us what to do. It is inherently contrary to what we think god should be.

We always need a certain amount of logic to maintain a god, however gods primarily need to be emotional. This is to say that our gods need to have divine right, at least in our minds, to make us feel everything from crushing sadness to complete euphoria.

Get an idea of why some parents are more effective at being gods than others?


### When we create gods.


In this sense we tend to make gods out of those who are manipulative.

This is particularly the resulting during break ups, where people end up forming gods of their partners because of how they made them feel.

We dictate in our minds that the other person is the reason for our existence, happiness and purpose, which is why we can find break ups entirely different to handle. Once they leave us we feel completely empty and void with no way of coping.

We have a very difficult time letting go of our gods, because our emotions bypass our logic and we end up compensating with false logic, to compensate for the way we feel.

For example our partner may have been abusive, however to cope with them no longer being in our lives, we create the logic in our minds that they were actually sweet so to justify their absence and our emotional suffering.

This is otherwise known as delusion and is common to those attached to their gods. They give up their own logical well-being to compensate for their emotions.

It is very difficult to convince people otherwise when they are delusional. They create a constant stream of logical inconsistencies and changes to the way they think, to compensate for their emotional state.


### Dissolving our gods.


Usually people break out of their delusion by reaching a certain point where the emotional pain of maintaining their god exceeds the pain of admitting that they are entirely wrong and delusional.

One of the reasons why it is helpful to dissolve gods is that they generally outlive their usefulness. Once we begin having to justify our gods against logic, then they no longer serve as something useful in our lives for personal growth.

We all use some form of religion as a way to help us to understand the world, however honest truth exists in having an open mind where truth is free to explore, rather than in a rigid structure where knowledge is limited.

When we focus too much on our ideas and feelings of god, we neglect more honest versions of the truth in favour for institution and authority - aspects of society which are easily and readily abused for personal gain.

Religion is not a bad thing per say. We all create beliefs which stem from our feelings and emotions, however to use our emotions and feelings as a guide for the truth is a very dangerous path to take which is a precursor for delusion.

Dissolving our gods require that we honestly expose ourselves to the inconsistencies of our logic relative to our emotions. This means exposing why our gods make us either feel guilty, shameful, happy, euphoric and whether our logic is consistent with our gods or with our feelings.

For example if we believe that our past partner is a saint, are we merely saying this in our mind to be consistent with who they actually are or are we making this logic up in our mind to compensate for them no longer being in our lives?

What makes this process particularly difficult is that our relationship with our gods can be so entirely complex and vast that we could have thousands upon thousands of rational justifications that we need to address in order to understand.

Naturally if we spend years building up a god, it will take a while to also dismantle them as well.

If anything, understanding the inconsistencies in god is what religion should be about. It should be about uncovering the truth, irregardless whether it offends you.
