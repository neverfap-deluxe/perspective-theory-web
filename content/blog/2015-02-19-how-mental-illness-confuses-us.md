Prolonged mental illness can leave us in a haze of confusion.

Our thoughts. Our emotions. We can barely know what to believe anymore. We feel incomplete and broken, like there is a part of us that we simply will never understand.

When people diagnose depression they look at the symptoms you may have that suggest depression – such as insomnia, thought rumination, sadness etc. The problem is that we run into danger and even more confusion when we confuse these symptoms as the cause of our depression.

Depression itself is just a symptom, a result of the underlying cause of depression, not the depression itself. The mental illness is simply a symptom of your cognitive dissonance, rather than the source of your misunderstanding.

For some people this cognitive dissonance comes in the form of an actual mental or physical disability - however for most people (particularly unipolar depression) it merely acts as a symptom of misunderstanding.

This is why self-awareness is helpful, because it can help us learn the skills necessary to identify our misunderstanding, as well as understand how we function, so that we don’t end up feeling so confused.

**The symptom is not the cause.**

We have this mentality in society of addressing our symptoms, rather than the cause of our symptoms. I believe it is because we have a poor understanding of logic and perspective in today’s society.

If our jobs are stressful and do not make us happy then we are told to take pills, drink caffeine and force our body to make ourselves more productive while we work. Sleep, diet and health are the underlying causes, yet they neglected.

We even find ways to rationalise our behaviour. We tell ourselves that we do not have the time to address the underlying causes, however in most cases we simply think that the symptoms are the problem – not our responsibility to ourselves.

It is a hopeless attitude that provides us with no opportunity to improve and achieve a lifestyle not sustained beyond the narrative of our emotions. Without thinking and being active in our lives, we simply cannot have any amount of hope.

Hope is vital in all aspects to our lives. It is what has kept us going since the very day we were born.

**Misunderstanding understanding.**

It is fair to say that some people are disadvantaged in significant ways. It could be a physical disability and even depression itself is a disadvantage worth noting.

Yet neither of these things should ever denote or undermine the responsibility for discovering who you are and your quest to understand your circumstances in life.

This is about understanding the assumptions that we make about ourselves. Why we shouldn’t attach to the identities of who we should be in our mind. The fallacy of feeling shameful or worthless because of our circumstance. The dangers of taking things personally.

Everything that our mind has to throw at us. Every single objection, limitation, logical fallacy – everything that has control over the way we feel about ourselves. Our aim is to be free and in-control of ourselves, which is entirely possible if you so choose.

Obviously this is a seemingly difficult task, especially when we are so depressed in our lives that we barely want to hold on and I guarantee this website will not be enough for all the perspective you will need in your life.

In fact, this website can really only provide the context for your epiphanies, because everyone’s circumstances are completely different. I personally remember it was only after a particular book one year after my break up, that things finally began to make sense.

What is important to understand is that our answers are out there and I guarantee that millions of people before you have experienced the same thing. It’s just about seeking the knowledge and people that are out there, just like you have in regards to this website.

**Self-awareness is key.**

Without taking the time to understand who you are and how your depression functions, quick fixes can only hope to distort who you truly are and make it harder to come back down to where you need to.

Drugs will always help make you feel better and there are an infinite amount of distractions on a daily basis to keep us occupied, however it cannot directly change our circumstances and I am not aware of any other healthy species that relies on medication to get through the duration of it’s life.

By becoming self-aware, we can learn to live without emotional suffering. We can learn from our emotions, rather than have them terrify us. It is a beautiful prospect to consider.
