Depression is a complex predicament.

It is not like a more common illness or disease where you can simply take a drug and hope for it to subside away. Depression encompasses everything in our lives, from the way we think, to the food we eat, to very life choices we make.

This is why perspective and self-awareness are such useful tools for us dissect and dismantle our depression. They are tools which we can successfully apply to any areas of our life, through observation and logic.

One of the significant issues with the complexity of depression is that it can instantly overwhelm us and our ability to act effectively.

People with depression are already confused enough, so where does one start if depression is so pervasive in our lives?

Even in having reached a point of knowing something is wrong, we still may not have any idea of how to approach it.

Certainly my own ability to control and manage my own depression did not come instantly. What I have come to understand is that everything we do in our lives assists towards our recovery (or depression), either for better or worse.

The sad thing is that we simply will not know until after our irrationality. Depression recovery can seem like a guessing game half the time.

Arguably I have been quite lucky with my recovery, in the quality of my predicaments and epiphanies - however this is no way discounts the amount of effort I also put in. I would like to think that there is a correlation between the two.

In fact even once I had learnt all the principles of self-awareness, it still took me a good year of self-discovery before any of it made proper sense to my life.

Our recovery can be a slow and often inconsistent process, however it necessary if not vital for our own wellbeing.


### Embracing the process.


Very few of us focus on the process of what it takes to solve our depression.

The process of learning to handle our depression is a fundamental part of what makes our depression manageable.

When we break things down into steps or procedures, our depression no longer seems so challenging. This really is no different with anything we do in life, whether we want to save up for a house or learn a new skill, having a plan gives us courage and hope to enact it.

I think part of the reason why we neglect any sort of process is because we think our depression is a necessarily permanent and unworkable state of mine.

This way of thinking extends from the faulty idea that mental clarity is a privilege.

While it is true that most people are born with mental clarity and stability, it is only through our parents, our peers and our experience that our beliefs and clarity becomes distorted for the worse.

Irregardless of how we started as innocent children, this is a transformation that affects us all.

While some people have been better guided in their lives growing, mental clarity itself is a skill no different to learning how to drive. Like our distortion of clarity, it is a skill that we develop with experience and knowledge.

Naturally if we have been taught in the wrong way, then reteaching ourselves is the only way out. This is a fundamental part of growing up.

The problem with seeing the world through the point of view of privilege is that it wholly encompass the self-defeating victim mentality of our minds.

We create narrative that we are not good enough and less worthy, because we do not have what others have. Especially with the power of image and perception, it is incredibly easy to exaggerate this image and deceive ourselves as to what we are even capable of having, making us feel worse.

We find it a lot easier to compare ourselves to images and develop self-defating and reinforcing narratives, simply because it is consistent with our attitude.

Through shame and guilt we find meaning in our beliefs, simply because they reflect they way we feel.

If we are to change who we are, then we must also change the process with which we think and view our lives.

Funnily enough, we also believe that taking initiative and embracing ambition in our lives is equally as self-defeating.

So what is the point in even trying?


### Changing our attitude.


As cliche as it sounds, it all starts off with our attitude towards life.

There are a number of things that are equally as important, such as understanding the context of our depression, such as how our beliefs function and why we need to use process, however our attitude is what makes this understanding and process sharp and effective.

To explain this concept of attitude, it helps to compare at the process of overcoming our depression to the process of learning a new language.

At first you literally cannot comprehend anything. None of the grammar or the vocabulary makes any sense to you and knowing that it will take at least six hundred hours to learn the language at even a basic level fills you with self-doubt.

If we take a pessimistic attitude towards this conundrum, then learning this language will seem like a long and torturous process. Not only to we negate ourselves of purpose, but we severely limit our will and ability to learn this language.

With any sort of pessimistic attitude, we prevent ourselves from achieving anything successfully. Even when we are forced to pursue outcomes out of necessity, such as an income, we do it with such little passion and enjoyment that it becomes entirely ineffective.

With this attitude we stop enjoying the things we used to love in life and everything becomes born out of torture, rather than in hope and ambition.

With an optimistic attitude however, we feel primed to achieve anything in life. Language no longer becomes this gargantuan problem which weighs us down. It becomes this nobility challenge which we use to inspire us each and every day.

With optimism we create hopeful visions of the future.

We visualise all the opportunities this language will give us. All the millions of new people we will be able to talk to. The different countries we will be able to visit.

It is through optimism that we can use our predicaments to empower us and develop a sense of self-esteem through the process we have followed. The feeling of achievement and success comes from hard work, not privilege.

There is no amount of empowerment in the shame and guilt that we feel for ourselves because of the belief that others are better than us. While it may validate our lives, it does nothing to give us hope and strength to change and move on.

Certainly I am not saying that you should be optimistic 100% of the time. I believe any sort of optimism that is not used from the point of view as a skill or a mental tool is incredibly dangerous.

However from the point of view of a skill it is a necessary part of optimally pursing our ambitions in life.

Now we may not want to learn a language. We may want to be able to overcome our additions or our depression or learn to have enough self-control to save our money to save for a holiday.

In order to do these things, our process and subsequent attitude is fundamental to achieving our ambitions.


### Mastering our depression.


The fact is, depression is something which you will have to master if you ever wish to be effective and successful in your life, otherwise we will suffer needlessly until the day we die.

There is no way around it.

We can feel deterred and overwhelmed by not having a process in place and we can adopt pessimistic and self-defeating attitudes, however this still does not change our predicament in any way.

Even once we have spent the six hundred hours to learn our language, this does not mean that we done with our learning process.

What if we want to become fluent? We have to practice and use the language every day in a whole range of situations and we have to write and read and cover everything from every angle.

Depression as I’m sure we’re all aware can be like an easy language for some and an incredibly complex language for others, however it is only in our attitude that we allow our predicament to be more difficult than it should be.

While nothing happens without a process and this process does not function without a proper attitutude.

There are many different ways to learn and adopt these aspects into our lives and being self-aware of ourselves and our behaviours can take us one step closer towards mental clarity.

Through small steps we achieve large.
