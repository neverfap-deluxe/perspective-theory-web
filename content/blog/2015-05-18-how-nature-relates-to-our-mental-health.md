There are many different views of what nature is. Many people view nature as something that requires taming or conquering. They believe that human addiction and greed are basic byproducts of nature’s treacherous ways.

Nature can be viewed as a wild and uncontrollable vixen that either blesses you with it’s calm or forces you into submission, regardless of the innocence or guilt you portray. When natural disasters or diseases come knocking at our door, it is not as if we have much choice but to brace ourselves and prepare.

Of course, this is only one view of nature.

There is an old, traditional idea that nature is a form of order rather than a form of chaos.

Even though nature might appear chaotic, that is not to say that it cannot convey a lot of sense, which is to say that there is always reason in the madness.

For example as much as we fear death, it is an entirely natural process that gives our lives meaning and due process.

In-spite of the anger or negativity we might have towards nature, there tends to be more merit in trying to understand how nature works, rather than trying manipulate and influence it to suit our agenda.

In a sense it is necessary for survival to manipulate nature (such a creating energy through chemical processes i.e. ethanol) however in the process we tend to merely postpone the inevitable that nature has in plan for us (i.e. peak population growth.)


### Why we reject nature.


I believe the reason why we reject nature is because we misunderstand what nature is along with the significance it has to our lives.

Nature is not a foreign object as we commonly feel it is. It is not some kind of idealism that only exists in a land faraway where there is no humanity or civilisation. Nature literally encompasses every single aspect of our conscious and material existence. In many ways, it is what we commonly refer to as God.

Part of the reason why we misunderstand nature is a) we have a distorted and exaggerated view of what nature is and b) because of how radically unnatural our lives are to this point of view.

When we try and picture nature we typically think of the colour green.

We imagine vast fields of healthy grass and wildlife, encompassed by a clear stream of water which has conveniently emerged from a luscious forest of growth and prosperity.

We associate nature with the ideas of health, grow, sustainability and almost as a form of utopia.

As such, we tend to reject nature once we become accustomed to our own surroundings. When all we see is buildings and concrete on a daily basis, nature becomes this very foreign and almost mystical idea in our minds.

It is from this point of view that we isolate ourselves from nature and assume that we are somehow immune from nature itself.

Instead we start believing in the power and sophistication of our unnatural lives. We think we can actually sustain ourselves by frequently staying indoors and living unhealthy, sedentary lives.

We actually convince ourselves that we are immune from nature because it so unapparent in our lives.

Furthermore we actually begin to believe that technology can overcome and make nature redundant, when technology can only help assist us come abide my nature more easily - which unfortunately we did the opposite in the past.

Ultimately, as we come to reject nature, we essentially lose touch with ourselves and our potential and purpose in life.


### How nature conveys truth.


Nature is a science.

It is the science of life and by embracing nature, not only can we come to better understand ourselves, however provide perspective to help us accustom ourselves with our unnatural world.

To demonstrate this, one of the common dilemmas that nature and people are concerned with diet.

With all these fad diets and pills going around, there is this idea that we can have the best of both worlds - where we can lose weight without effort or struggle. Of course, the issue is that we never actually look at the cause of why we struggle to lose weight to begin with (the nature of the situation).

We simply assume that nature has been exclusively unfair with us and that we must overcome or manipulate it to achieve our goals. We do not question the role of exercise in our lives or if exercise is not helping, the kinds and types of foods we eat on a daily basis.

So we go on fad diets that end up being unsustainable and unhealthy, which inevitably fail and have us further feeling helpless about our ability to change. This is because after a while, we simply allow our negative perception of nature to take hold of us and we simply assume that nature is non-functioning and unfair by design.

We assume complete misconceptions of how everything works, based on all the repeated bad experiences and failures we have in our lives. We subconsciously reinforce the cycle of struggle without knowing it, and
we ignore the science of nature and we suffer the consequence of ignorance.

For example one of the reasons why we struggle with sugar cravings is because we lack the sufficient intake of healthy fats to suppress our cravings.


### Embracing nature.


The key takeaway from this article is clear.

If we abide by the laws of nature, then life does not have to be difficult.

This means however that we need to change the way that we view nature. We need to nature as something that is functioning and that we are the ones who are lacking function instead.

We need to understand the world from a natural point of view, rather than from the point of view of humanity. There needs to be a harmony; a co-existence between the two forces, otherwise we simply end up harming and making things more difficult than ourselves.

Most importantly, we need to stop thinking in terms of ideology - that is human orientated solutions based in utopian thinking (that we can lose weight healthy with no effort) and instead rely on the science of nature which has already perfected the life process over billions of years.

This is to say that there cannot be alternatives to nature, only ideas which compliment the power of nature.

It is a powerful point of view because it inherently conveys hope to the solutions that we seek to all our problems.

Nature can give us a source of trust and certainty in life, rather than uncertainty. Through self-awareness and perspective, we can ultimately come closer to nature and understand how it can best compliment our own lives.
