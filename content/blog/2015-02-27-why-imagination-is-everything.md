Imagination is wonderful.

It is through our imagination that we experience reality as well all of the wonderful thoughts and dreams that our mind can conjure. Imagination is what brings our thoughts and emotions to life.

Imagination is like an enhancement of reality. It augments our ability to conceive and feel ideas, which can lead to empowering euphoria or crippling depression. Imagination is merely a tool for us to experience the world around us, which can also distance ourselves from reality.

I want you to imagine your favourite food right now. I want you to imagine the texture of that food in your mouth, how it would taste. Imagine the food being in-front of you, ready to eat. Imagine the smell of food and let that smell linger. Really try and recreate the smell.

We can just as easily do the same with our emotions and thoughts. We can make ideas come to life in our head, either for empowerment or poverty. It is simply a matter of understanding how imagination functions and how we can use it for the positive.


### The imagination of the mind.


Imaginations are limitless in their capacities. They have the ability to feel entirely real and daunting, even though they only exist as images in our mind.

This is part of the reason why we can feel ecstatically happy one moment, yet in a state of wallow only moments later. We all personally have particularly stories or images that trigger our emotions, be it the death of a loved one or a reminder from the past.

Our imagination likes to recreate things from the past, simply as a way to channel our emotions. Imagination allows us to transcend beyond our circumstances and experience ideas and memories in our head... even events that may not even have happened at all.

Imagination is simply a tool which allows us to experience. Sometimes we recreate these scenes in our head for the sake of emotion.

Issues arise when we develop and reinforce these patterns in our mind so that we end up imagining negative things without truly wanting to. Since our imagination exaggerates these events in our mind, it can make us ending up feeling worse and worse about ourselves.

We end up spiraling into depression with our imagination reinforcing our harmful behaviours.


### The irrational exuberance of imagination.


Our minds are brilliant at tricking us.

For example the mind has a way of rewarding ourselves today at the expense of the future. You know when something really goes your way, like when you finally land a date with someone who you think is special?

Instead of simply acknowledging this achievement we get greedy in our minds. Using our imagination we exaggerate this event and build it up beyond what it actually is.

We imagine how happy we are going to be when we are with them. We picture the sex, the subsequent marriage. This is usually a reflection of those with optimistic attitudes.

Alternatively it could be that you are inherently pessimistic about the world. You think that the date is going to turn out horribly. You think that maybe the person could be an asshole. You decide not to even give the date a chance.

When we dream in our minds we create false expectations for ourselves. What is important to understand is how we use our imagination and whether we use it for harmless endeavours or instead to inspire us to live fulfilling lives.

When we live in the world of the imagination, similar to how people use video games and TV shows as an escape, then things can begin to fall apart once we return to reality.

We feel almost cheated once our expectations and hopes crumble. This is why it is important to accept and embrace reality, as a way not only of coping, but experiencing enthusiasm without the associated smokescreens.


### Respecting imagination.


As you can imagine it is incredibly important that we understand how properly use our imagination so that we do not completely exaggerate reality.

Imagination is best used if we do not put our faith into it. It is not a guide so much as it is an enhancement or experience.

While imagination is amazing at creating ideas and inspiring us, it should not be used as a motivation or purpose itself. Imagination needs a solid foundation of effective beliefs and interpretations in order to be effective.

If we use our emotions and thoughts as a form of inspiration and a foundation for our beliefs instead, then we can still use our imagination while not having to fully take our wild interpretations personally.

We essentially prevent our imaginations from being limitations. It is a way of keeping us grounded to reality.


### Imagination is just a tool.


Ultimately imagination is just a tool for the mind. It is neither good or bad, however it can just as easily be used for either.

It is those who do not understand these paradigms that end up hurting themselves the most. We end up jaded, in a state of self-criticism and denial, and the list goes on. On the other hand we can use imagination to inspire us, to give us ideas and appreciate the things we have in life.

By being self-aware of these ideas and concepts of the mind, we can effectively manage our emotions and behaviours and not be victim to the inner workings of the mind.
