Our beliefs are what make fundamentally different from each other.

They are constructs of our mind which dictate who we are and how we view the world. They can even have the effect of changing our perception entirely beyond truth itself.

Beliefs are incredibly important for our everyday function, however they should never remain unguided or unchecked.

Adopting open and alternative perspectives and mindsets is also very important for regulating our beliefs and keeping them honest.

These perspectives include alternative empathetic and accepting points of view, as well as learning to simply exist without image or ego in our lives.

It is important to keep our beliefs in check is so that we can prevent ourselves from developing irrational beliefs. These arise from failing to question the faulty assumptions that we make about, and with, the world.

I am sure we all have a number of irrational fears and beliefs based upon exaggerated assumptions of the way we perceive reality, such as the perception that spiders are life threatening.

Certainly a lot of these beliefs are not as irrational as they may seem, however it is when we allow our beliefs to impede on our daily function that they can become truly problematic.


### Why are beliefs important?


Beliefs are important because they have the potential to make life radically easier… just as they can make life exponentially more difficult.

Instead of having to constantly assess and analyse our surrounding situations, we can instead generalise all this information into a set of beliefs that help us navigate through life.

For these beliefs to be effective they need to be based in truth. For example, if we assume that jumping off a building is going to be a quicker route to our car rather than taking the elevator, then we may be in for a bit of a surprise.

While the stated premise is actually true in that it is a lot quicker, it does not paint the whole picture and we overlook vital assumptions about our own ability to survive.

Thankfully beliefs generally function on the premise of repeated generalisations as a way of helping us automate a lot of our behaviours and feelings so that we do not need to constantly make these assumptions.

The primary issue here is that if we form beliefs around repeated generalisations that are based in bad or exaggerated experiences of our live, such as past trauma, then we can form irrational beliefs that cause us to suffer.


### How we form irrational beliefs.


Our beliefs largely arise from what we have experienced in life and it is from this point of view that we tend to seek other points of view that best reflect our experiences.

Yet not only do these points of view reflect our lives, however they also reinforce them by reconfirming exactly what we have experienced.

This is why depressed people can remain depressed if they constantly surround themselves with people who are also mentally ill. It is because they constantly allow this point of view to mould and reinforce these beliefs about the world.

It is the reason why we read only certain news outlets or even feel inspired to learn an instrument or a language.

It also means that our beliefs are incredibly fallible and can easily be reprogrammed by exposing ourselves to different points of view. Our beliefs are not so much irrational as they are a product of our environment.

If we experience the same thing again and again (particularly traumatic episodes) then we can generalise these experiences to form our expectation of reality.

Irrational environments spur irrational beliefs and furthermore, having one irrational belief can often form the faulty basis for a whole number of other beliefs.

This can be particularly difficult for children who have been abused or experienced trauma, because they are affected when they are at their most impressionable. Their beliefs can form incredibly strongly and are difficult to overcome, even as an adult.

However, it is well after the initial trauma that we continue to subject ourselves to irrational environments as a way reinforcing our beliefs and mindsets.


### Keeping an open mind.


The only effective way to keep our beliefs in check is to maintain an open mind about reality, particularly the ways with which we may unconsciously reinforce our points of view and behaviours.

This means learning to retract the judgmental mind, as well as learning to become aware of how our beliefs function, such as acknowledging they that are largely a product of our environment and that our intuition can be skewed and do not always reflect our best intentions.

While it is impossible to actually exist without our beliefs, that does not mean that we cannot dissolve our irrational or harmful beliefs through a number of cognitive processes.

We can do this directly by exposing the faulty assumptions with which we have created or even by observing our beliefs in real time.

With self-awareness and perspective we can slowly change the way that we think, especially by understanding how the mind functions.
