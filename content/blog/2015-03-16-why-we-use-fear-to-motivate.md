Fear is a psychological trait that we all utilise in our own lives.

We use fear not only as a way to control others, however more commonly, we use fear to try and control ourselves.

We use it as a way to bypass our logic and tap into our emotions directly. In fact it is so effective at bypassing our emotions that we use it to motivate ourselves. We use it as an alternative to proper inspiration, using a false sense of scarcity and urgency to push us forward instead.

Fear is ineffective because it does not carry as any further than our own primal instinct. It does not provide the logic and rationalisation for effective planning and foresight into the future, so that our actions may be truly effective.

Fear allows us to mobilise, however once the initial threat or perception of threat has disappeared, we simply fall into a state of anxiety and panic, once we realise how truly lost and dissociated we truly are.

Unfortunately fear does not liberate us towards our goals, which is why true ambition and inspiration can provide. This is why learning to be self-aware of our fear is important for us to change and become more effective.


### How we use fear.


Fear itself is a basic form of emotional manipulation.

The reason why we use fear is because we believe we will be ineffective at influencing others and ourselves logically. When all reason breaks down, we believe fear will yield a more positive of a response, if any response at all.

The issue with this approach is that we need to constantly micromanage people’s emotions and response towards fear. It is a dishonest ruse with several far-reaching consequences.

For example we may display anger to try and protect ourselves from people we feel threatened by; even the people we love and respect. Not only does this attitude isolate people, however it does nothing to make anyone feel comfortable, nor compel them to be honest and co-operative towards us.

If the person ever figures out that this fear is intangible and merely used as a form of emotional manipulation (rather than necessity), then the entire relationship of trust and authority may break down.

The other person may begin to react with counter-manipulation, which merely hopes to degrade the quality of any relationship.

Now you can imagine why using fear on ourselves is equally as disastrous.


### Fear and children.


The reason why we use fear on children is because we believe they are incapable of logic.

This may work for a while, however once they become older and develop a keen logical capacity, it does not become long until they figure out the parent's ruse and rebel against their illusion of power.

This false understanding that fear can be constantly used to control children, merely creates resent in their minds and is the reason for many family relationship breakdowns.

The problem with using fear is that it negates our ability to inspire them emotionally instead. Perhaps we think it is too difficult to communicate with our children in this way, however most prominently it is because it is how we have been brought up ourselves - with fear.

We use fear because we fail to empathise with others. Since we believe that others are incapable of reason, we end up treating these people like emotional and logical idiots with strings to be tinkered with.

Though what makes fear so appealing in our minds, is because we are so focused on the outcome of our actions, rather than the process and consequence of our actions. It is in this failure that we fail to foresee our faults.

While in some cases fear may be warranted if a situation if truly urgent or hopeless, to abuse this privilege is to display an inherent lack of care and concern.

We use it as a convenience, though it is usually a convenience that does not last very long for either party.


### Why fear is an ineffective motivator.


The main problem with using fear is that while it can help us mobilise, it ultimately fails to provide us with any tangible hope or process for the future.

Even when we momentarily lose hope, it can seem that everything has broken down into a pointless realm of endless torture.

While fear can create a short burst of urgency, it merely sets us up for anxiety, panic and future depression - as the fear eventually runs out.

This is what causes us to fall back into routine depression and more unfortunately, embrace it is the full capacity of function.

Instead, we should always use possibility and ambition to motivate us. Without true inspiration in our lives, we cannot hope to change our ways for the long run.

As long as we appeal to other people's (and our own) raw emotions, we can never hope to truly develop a deep and meaningful sense of co-operation, trust and genuine care.

We need a balance of reason and logic, the things that make humanity great and powerful, in conjunction with our emotions and feelings, in order to be effective at appealing towards others and particularly ourselves.

Tragically some of us have nothing but fear to offer in our lives, though it is never too late to learn and become self-aware of our own feelings and behaviours.


### Embracing ambition.


Fear is a deep feeling inside us all.

While our emotions are capable of short-circuiting our logic, our failure to master logic is what generally trips us into depression in the first place.

This is perfectly fine and where nearly all of us start - incapable of distinguishing logic.

After so many years of being manipulated by our parents and the people in our lives, subconsciously and unaware, we naturally feel confused and lost as to how we can regain our focus and purpose in life.

This is why it is important that we master the art of perspective and logic, not only so we can understand the context of our mental illness, but so piece by piece, we can regain control over of our mental illness and get down to the core of who we are.

Many people give into their fears, either rationalising their feelings through some form of rumination or by simply living in denial about who they are and what they are capable of.

In many ways, this is as much a psychological question as it is a physiological one. Fear is just an aspect of what causes our depression.

By learning to become self-aware, fear can become a thing of the past. Fear has it’s place, however it is not effective inspiration and it seldom helps people truly understand their depression without distancing themselves from who they want to be.
