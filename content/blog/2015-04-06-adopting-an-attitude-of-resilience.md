Resilience is a quality few of us have embraced.

As children we were taught through a system of rule and structure, where method and instruction was praised as the most efficient way to achieve our goals and dreams.

If we wanted to get really good at an instrument, we were told to practice the same things each day. If we want to complete a maths problem, then naturally we have to follow the formulas given to us.

There was always a clear question and answer with everything we did as children and to question the rule of law was an act beyond our own capabilities and mind.

Yet resilience is so incredibly important and valuable in our lives, especially in regards to successfully managing our own mental health.

By embracing resilience we can not only keep in line with our goals and ambitions without difficulty, however we can easily maintain perspective over our own mental illness.

Resilience is not just about change, but it's also about learning when not to change, as well what we can and should change, in order to maintain the stabilities and strategies that are currently working in our life.

Often we either change too much or too little in our lives and it simply ends up frustrating us. Arguably it is one of areas of our mental health we have the most difficulty with.

I suppose resilience is another word for mindfulness. It is a way of expressing perspective, by being mindful of our own lives so that we can work to the best of our interests, rather than fight and conflict with the logic and emotion in our minds.

Resilience comes down to maintaining perspective over our problems and learning more about ourselves so that we can have a greater capacity to influence ourselves and prevent future situations from affecting us.

Most importantly, resilience is a skill that we gain through practice and as we learn more about ourselves, the more resilient we can truly be.


### Losing resilience.


It’s funny how we can feel perfectly fine and then almost in an instant, fall into depression and sadness like we’d never seen a smile in our entire lives.

One of the biggest misconception that people have of resilience is that it is a passive understanding of ourselves. Rather, resilience is our active ability to remain stable and not let our emotions or feelings take control.

Our resilience is something that we need to maintain and work on every single day. The good news is that it infinitely becomes easier the more we discover and learn about ourselves.

This is not to say that we will not have our setbacks or our bad days where everything falls apart. It merely means that we'll be more prepared to deal with it next time when it strikes.

Mental illness should be viewed as a capacity within us all, that if properly maintained and managed, cannot get the better of us.

As a result, there is no substitute for an attitude of hard work and ambition towards our mental illness, as is with anything else in life, no matter the challenge and this is a direct reflection on our ability to remain resilient.


### Maintaining resilience.


The best way to maintain perspective is to gain it and the main reason why we fail to maintain perspective is because we do not have enough of it to manage the way we think and feel.

People who have difficultly maintaining perspective in their lives, are merely an extension of their simple lack of perspective.

So in order to be resilient, we must have perspective in our lives.

This means the perspective required to prevent ourselves from falling back into depression and even more importantly, so we can quickly bounce back from depression once it strikes.

A large part of resilience comes down to the way we feel about ourselves. When we experience depression, we feel lost with our self-esteem and our emotions seem to turn against us.

There are many different ways we can manage our emotions to create perspective in our lives, such as through dancing or healthy eating. Many more are covered on this website and this is a preventative measure that allows us to be maintain resilience easier.

Resilience itself however is a mindset that we have towards our problems in-spite of how we feel. We all go through levels of trauma in our lives, however it is through how we deal with these problems that defines our ability to be resilient.

Simply thinking about resilience in our lives is something which can help us keep mindful about our own mental health.

It is about understanding the reason why we doubt ourselves, why we fail to be honest with our own intentions, including the hundreds of other ways that we sabotage our own mental wellbeing.


### Adopting resilience.


As resilience is a mindset, our attitude towards life is fundamental to changing the way we feel about ourselves and act with intention.

Resilience can be thought of a form of optimism in many ways and when we are down and our self-esteem is distraught, obtaining any amount of optimism can almost seem impossible.

On the contrary, there are a lot of small things that we can do to create self-esteem in our lives and restore confidence with ourselves.

We can set small challenges for ourselves that demonstrate we are not useless. It can be something as simple as going for a walk to the shops or even attempting to tidy our room.

While this is an effective strategy for the long run, especially if we lack perspective in our lives, tying our self-worth to our goals can become dangerous, especially since confidence is an emotion we feel within ourselves, rather than a reflection of our identity.

This is why I prefer to do things that release endorphins and make me feel energetic, like dancing or working out. Of course, this is a strategy that primarily works if you already have perspective over your problems and if you simply need an emotional response to get you out of your rut.

Naturally there are thousands of different ways to maintain perspective and promote resilience, many of which I try and cover through out this website. Through correct technique and perspective, we can easily dissect and our mental illness.

Even once we have a grasp over ourselves, it does not mean that our mental illness is any weaker or less relevant in our lives. It just means that by being resilient, we can maintain our mental illness and not have to worry or live with any unnecessary suffering.
