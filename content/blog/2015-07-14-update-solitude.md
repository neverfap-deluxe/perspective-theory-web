*Ahem*

Firstly I would like to apologise for the lack of content that has been running the proverbial rounds as of late.

A lot has been happening in my life and I am incredibly proud of the 90,000 words that I have bashed out in the space of a few short months. It makes me very proud and I truly hope to make this website into something wonderful.

<!-- more -->

Well, let's be quite frank. I have actually been spending most of my time learning web design and studying French, but it's always good to take a break from writing to contemplate and on what makes this life so special!

To be more frank however, I developed a sort of carpal tunnel/joint pain from writing so much for the website that I decided to take a break and heal the hands. Subsequently I only plan on posting three articles a week, however that just gives me more time to put more quality into the articles that are delivered.

There are a lot of things that I am doing behind the scenes that will hopefully make this website a more user-friendly and valuable resource for those wanting the insight and advice on their own mental health issues.

Amongst those I am:



	  * Going back through each and every article to get a better idea of what I have/haven't written thus far.
	  * In the process of interlinking every single article on the website.
	  * Changing articles titles to better suit their purpose.
	  * As well as small cosmetic changes so the website doesn't feel so barren.

It's hard work trying to create a successful and useful website, however I know it will be worth it in the end, especially considering how horrible depression is.

If you would like to support the website you can also consider joining us on the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/perspectivetheory?fref=ts) where we blah, blah, blah.

Sincerely,

Julius Reade
