Doubt itself seems like a natural state of mind. It is as if we begin from absolute uncertainty before working our way up from the original state of doubt.

While we can be certain of some things more than others, we largely view the world as a place of uncertainty, rather than a world that a place of which can be predetermined.

In response to this uncertainty, we do everything in our power to try and create as much certainty as possible. We educate ourselves, we gain the trust of others, we get married, we live.

Yet no matter how certain in life we are, there is always thousands of different ways in which things can go wrong and take certainty from us. Equally so, there is only one way for things to go right- for example, the only aim of marriage is to stay together, though there are hundreds of ways this union can fall apart.

What we may not realise is that these are actually pessimistic attitudes, rather than whole truths.

While it is easy to see the world as a place of potential failure, it is also just as easy to see it as a place of opportunity. It simply comes down to our attitude and the way we see the world.

In addition, our pessimistic attitudes can cause us to have false assumptions about life about and what certainty is. For example, even though we may value marriage, is our happiness more important than staying in a marriage that makes us miserable?

In our pessimistic attitude, we simply do not aim to change our circumstances, but accept misery as a standard in our lives. Furthermore, it detracts from whenever we do experience happiness or do well in our lives.

Doubt gives the impression of seeing normal, however it is a simple by-product of the way we look at the world. If we think in terms of our goals and ambitions and successes, then doubt no longer becomes an essential frame of mind.

In addition doubtful points of views tend to make us focus on ways to sabotage our goals and ambitions, rather than discover ways in which we can empower ourselves and contribute towards our life goals. It can serve as unnecessary resistance.

Of course there is nothing wrong with doubt itself and it may be useful. It is only when we doubt excessively and unnecessarily that it can cause us issues.

By adopting an attitude of determination rather than doubt, we can allow ourselves options to work with, rather than focus on the potential for failure.


### Why we create doubt.


Doubt is an almost instinctive response.

It is a deep feeling we have inside us which tries to protect us from failure. It is a way of stopping us before we have even bothered trying.

It is important to understand that doubt is merely a feeling that we condition ourselves to express as a way of responding to life.

If we embrace this feeling enough, we can learn to doubt every single one of our circumstances, rather than truly look at things from a point of hope and determination.

By refraining from this feeling, either by addressing the faulty logic in our minds that create doubt or by learning to develop effective self-esteem, we can learn to look at things from the point of view of hope and opportunity. There are a number of ways in which my website describes the process of doing.

Learning to create hope in our lives is essential to recovering from any amount of excessive depression or emotional instability, not only from a cognitive point of view, however also from a perspective point of view.

In particularly it can make us resilient and highly effective as people, no matter how our mental illness manages to challenge us. Of course, our aim is to eventually live without mental illness rather than as a response to it.

No longer do I spend months at a time in a state of depression, usually only a few hours at a most and episodes have dropped dramatically.


### Why we give up on hope.


Many people never attempt hope because of misconception of what it is.

Some people hold onto pessimism like it is an ultimate virtue of mankind, however terms like pessimism and optimism are merely terms used to describe reality.

Pessimism can be one person's optimism, just as optimism can serve as pessimism in another person's circumstance. It is difficult to compare subjective terms, though it is possible to make comparisons through our own personal objectives.

Hope itself is largely a construct of our minds that we create to appease our ego, much in the same way that hopelessness is a way for us to validate our personal feelings and thoughts.

It helps to think of our attitude as an extra layer on top of everything that we already do. Our attitude can only hope to serve as a guide, as a inspiration to the things we do.

It is there to assist us in our hard work and ambition, not as a replacement for our own actions which many pessimists assume it does, primarily because they use their own pessimism to substitute for their own actions and so they naturally assume that optimism is no better.

Both optimism and pessimism can be abused if not use correctly, pessimism more so.

So in our pessimism, we create doubt because we actually believe it will help us. We believe that through pessimism and cynicism, we can actually better understand the world when really it can only serve to protect us from the world.

It is important to think critically about our attitudes, rather than rely on them to guide us. Without a way to critically think about our attitudes, as well as a basis of ambition to support them.

Doubt can be helpful as a way of limiting or removing harmful options, though not as a way of creating options.

If we want to earn millions of dollars, then being doubtful about approaching the lottery can help us, however determination should be thought of as the backbone of everything we do.

With determination however, we can still think critically and still achieve our goals all the same.
