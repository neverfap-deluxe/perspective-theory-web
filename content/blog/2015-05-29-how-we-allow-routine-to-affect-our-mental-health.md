I am sure this is something we have all experienced.

We become inspired by something that fascinates us and draws our attention. We hear someone play the piano, and it inspires us to cultivate the talent for ourselves.

Our passion begins with an idea and in pursuing this idea, we realise that we are not progressing as fast as we would like to. We can feel the ambition run red through our veins and yet we feel like it is not being put to best use.

So we do our research into how to be more efficient with our time and we discover that having some sort of routine or structure is vital to helping us be consistent with our goals and effort.

In the beginning we embrace our routine with vigour and we notice the gradual progress that we create through the our routine. At this stage, we finally feel that there's a verifiable path towards reaching our goals and we come to feel more secure about who we are becoming.

In this process, we notice that we are gradually losing passion towards our goals and ambition. Sticking to our routine is not always fun, especially when we are not in the mood, and over time we can even grow to avoiding of what was once a passion.

We think to ourselves maybe that being a fine pianist is not all that it is cracked up to be, and we eventually pursue things which we feel provide less pressure to our lives.

We can lose perspective of our ambition and instead of focusing on our dreams and visions to carry us through, we leave them aside believing they were a temporary spark. We get caught up in the mundane tasks that we feel are necessary for success, yet bore us endlessly and make us feel dispassionate about life.

We simply view our goals and dreams as a by-product of our hard work and we become disheartened by our endeavours.


### What is passion and how do we lose it?


Passion is so much more than a simple desire. Passion is about the vision or dream that we create in our mind. It is the dream of who we want to become and the the effort associated with getting there.

When we initially imagine our goal we create an image in our mind that supports the tangibility of our goals. When we picture this image in our mind, we reignite our passion and excite ourselves about the possibility of who we can become in the future.

Passion is vital because it gives us drive and reason. Without passion, we end up being motivated only by money or stress which are nowhere near as efficient.

Passion is important because it changes the way we view our pursuits. Instead of viewing things as the challenges they are, we instead view them as enjoyable and necessary to our daily lives.

The reason why we lose passion once we adopt routine is because of how our visions and dreams become secondary to our routine. We take an opposite view of passion as merely being consequential of our actions and handwork, rather than the core driver of what we hope to achieve.

We focus so much on the technicalities of achieving our dream that we forget what brought us there in the first place. We distract ourselves thinking that it is in our best interest, assuming that efficiency and progress can hold on it’s own two feet - when we have it the wrong way around.

It is also important to know when we need to take a break from routine or when our routine needs to be changed. One of the reasons why we can become dispassionate is because we end up pursuing tasks that are no longer effective or helpful and so we stop progressing and lose hope.

Another way in which we lose passion is by becoming too obsessed with productivity to the point that we merely pursue these tasks to give our ego or identity a kick, rather than because it is truly helpful.

We can simply feel good for following a routine even if it may be ineffective and it is a comfort that a lot of people can fall into. Instead of actually pursuing our passion we instead pursue how efficiently we can do the tasks themselves.

These are forms of deception that we must become mindful of and act immediately on.


### Regaining passion in our lives.


In order to maintain our passion we not only need to critically think about our routines, but we need to find new and innovative ways to visualise and express the dreams and visions which give our passion life.

One of the ways we can do this is by writing lists of the things which we must complete each day. Not only is it visual in that we can we tick off all the activities that we complete, however it can also be helpful to write a reflection at the end of the day of what we could have done better.

These kinds of strategies are important because they validate our hard work as well as provide mindfulness through an activity that we can practice everyday.

It is also necessary to have a number of these strategies that we can cycle through as they generally only work for limited periods of time before we grow weary of them.

For example, while writing lists really helped me in the beginning, it came to a point where my routine was becoming so fluid that it was holding me back. Now I have the ability to simply rely on my intuition.

In addition, we need to start living with passion in everything we do, rather than just a select area of our life. Not only does this help us better adjust during difficult times, but it is a good practice to channel this energy as a way of approaching all our challenges in life.

If we are always passion then it makes it very difficult to create excuses or to lose momentum of who we are. The trick however is to not allow this passion to become an expectation of who we should be and like earlier, is why we need to have a number of these strategies and to devise ways that work well for us.

Ultimately this means realigning the way that we view passion in our lives and particularly of the way we draw purpose and inspiration from the world. With hopeful attitudes we can begin to value our time as something sacred with all our goals and necessities, as well as  draw inspiration from the most simple of things in life.


### Embracing our routines.


Having a routine is actually a blessing in disguise and it is only when we are unable to utilise this that we can become jaded about it. When we combine routine with passion we can learn to extract the best of both worlds of both efficiency and desire combined into one.

I think this comes down to balance ,and the more I practice mindfulness in my life, the more I realise that there is a common ground which needs to be met.

This means re-evaluating why we do the things in addition to completing the task itself. Are we merely trying to maintain a standard or are we doing it because we enjoy it? It can be a useful question to ask ourselves everyday.
