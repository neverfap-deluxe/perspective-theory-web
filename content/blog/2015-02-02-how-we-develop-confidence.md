Confidence means having your full unconditional trust.

If you do not have full trust in your own ability to manage yourself, be it your own mental health or any other aspect of your life, then you will naturally have a low sense of self-esteem (the result of false confidence).

Having a high sense of self-esteem (the result of true confidence) on the other hand comes down to understanding the fundamental relationship you have with your thoughts, abilities, and the way they relate to your life.

Notice the emphasis on self. To delegate our responsibility onto others, to rely on others for our own sense of self-esteem, is an inherently flawed and false way of experiencing confidence. This is because YOU actually give authority to other people, rather than authority being inherent trait within people. It is something that we create purely in our minds.

In fact, only you have authority within yourself to exist and act. This is because while we have the ability to create authority in others, we just as easily have the ability to take authority away.

Yet, we never truly have the ability to take authority away from ourselves.

The only way to develop a true sense of confidence is invest more in ourselves than we do in others - to trust our own authority and our own ability to act with authority.

To not acknowledge our own authority is to be dishonest with ourselves and our capacities as human beings. It is to doubt our potential for authority.


### How we lose confidence within ourselves.


It is very possible that we lack trust within ourselves because of the belief that our current knowledge and abilities are insufficient for our own purposes. This is perfectly fine and arguably, how we begin life - without knowledge or abilities.

If we are eager and patient to invest in ourselves, then this is no issue. It is wholly positive if we use our shortcomings to inspire us to exceed our current abilities and become better people.

What does prevent us from developing confidence however, is when we begin to lose faith in our own ability to learn, because of our own personal views of who we think we are in our minds, rather than our own true merits as people.

This evil is commonly known as doubt - the biggest killer of hopes and dreams that ever lived, well beyond our worst enemies. It is this idea that we are incapable of achieving greatness, even before we bother to try.


### How we construct doubt.


We doubt ourselves because it's easier than trying - at least according to the logic we employ in our minds. If you corrupt the logic behind your thoughts, then naturally they will come to hinder you.

Doubt is essentially a limitation, a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy that we create for ourselves to protect us from the prospect of every trying. By doubting our own ability, it already sets the standard for where we are going and where we intend to head.

Nowhere.

In a sense, what we do is we actually put our confidence into our doubt and our limitations, rather than in our own abilities. It's like saying it's easier to crash a car into the side of the road, rather than drive it down the full length of the road with safety.

We make so many assumptions about success and failure that we don't even give ourselves the opportunity to attempt either.

While success is put on this pedestal as an unobtainable asset, failure is heralded as the default alternative to not succeeding - hence not even trying. We have this idea in our minds that failure is easier, because we already are failures as people.

This idea that you are a failure until you are a success is a logic that a lot of people have.

These harmful logical fallacies, among many others, are ones that people hold true to themselves, and shall be addressed in later articles. However, it's important to note that there are many ways in which we construct doubt and limitations in our mind.


### Overcoming our limitations through perspective.


It helps to develop your confidence by embracing who you are, not only for your strengths, but more crucially for your vulnerabilities. What people don't realise is that confidence relies on our ability to embrace our vulnerabilities, rather than shun them.

Perspective is a tool which allows you to view and understand yourself from every angle. It is a way of better understanding who you are, as well as how you construct the limitations in your life through the logical fallacies you embrace on a daily basis.

In fact, we have been using perspective through out this entire article to explain how confidence and doubt works. It is through the logical fallacies in our mind that we construct the limitations we create within ourselves, which prevent us from having the confidence to improve our abilities and skills as people.

Through self-awareness, we can better learn to understand how we play out this logic in our mind.
