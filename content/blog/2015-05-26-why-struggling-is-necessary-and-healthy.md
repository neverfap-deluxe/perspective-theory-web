For many of us struggle is a way of life.

We struggle with our ability to create happiness in our lives in the same way that we struggle to prevent our depression and maintain our mental health.

In many ways we create this kind of struggle as a way of improving our circumstances and as a reflection of the high standards that we set onto ourselves.

If we are trying to juggle between work, university and bringing up our children, then inevitably we are going to struggle.

It can feel as if our struggle is amounting to nothing more than a cruel charade of pointless effort, as if we are truly helpless no matter how much we struggle. This kind of effort is a form of suffering,  and it is something which we must learn to distinguish.


### Why struggling is not suffering.


Struggle is important because it is a reflection of the ambition and greatness we hope to achieve.

To reject our struggle is to reject the ability of our own lives and is part of the reason people end up suffering instead. When we struggle it is because we are largely coming to terms with who we are and who we want to become; it is about discovering the process behind which makes us effective.

Suffering on the other hand contributes towards a limited  or ineffective amount of self-discovery, which is to say that suffering is struggle with no higher purpose.

A lot of people suffering from depression often assume that struggling and suffering are the same thing and as such, they develop incredibly cynical mindsets about life, especially towards achieving ambition. This is usually as a result of our trauma.

We can even validate our own experiences by believing that suffering is in fact a positive form of struggle. We can end up basking in our self-guilt and denial thinking that it is the best thing for our mental health and progression in life.

Of course any amount of self-criticism or self-harm cannot effectively help us in any way.

Things like trying to find the motivation to complete something difficult or improve on our health is inevitably going to involve some sort of challenge or struggle, however it is healthy as it is unavoidable.

Struggling is important because it demonstrates that we are working towards a future where we can have less struggle in our lives.

Part of the reason why we struggle and have ambition is so that we can experience life where we are wiser, smarter and more accomplished than before.

This is to say that struggle really is a concept of optimism about life while suffering is an inherently pessimistic way of viewing the world.

Our recovery is more than just a learning process of how best to overcome our mental illness. It is also an exercise of learning how to exceed at life and become the best versions of ourselves and without struggle, it is an aspect of our personality which we may never discover.


### Why do we struggle unnecessarily?


Struggle itself is a systematic process of learning to deal with the biological limitations that humans naturally face such as dealing with boredom, stress, our potential for addiction, self-defeating points of view etc.

The fact is that everyone struggles for the simple fact that life is unpredictable, non-routine and requires effort relative to our outcomes.

I must have personally procrastinated for a good 20 minutes before working up the courage to write this article and this is simply one of the challenges that I face in my ambition to make this website successful.

This concept of struggling is a very eastern philosophy, with struggling and suffering encompassing two sides of the same coin that is life.

Yet it is in this sense that both struggling and suffering can feel purposeful as if there is some kind of higher goal in the intensity of both.

I know personally from my depression I felt incredibly purposeful in the guilt that I felt from my trauma, however at the same time it also felt incredibly wonderful and purposeful to do working towards my life ambitions.

Part of maintaining our mental health is to learn not to abuse ourselves to take preference to suffering through self-harm, however to use this form of energy to do good in our lives.

The only reason why we suffer is because of the ignorance that we have of these issues, though when we are feeling so desperate we often have no choice and it is only in retrospect and with perspective that we feel as if we should have done differently.

Other times our curiosity can get the better of us.

If we grew up in families with little money or if our parents also learned to suffer, perhaps via alcoholism or lack of ambition, then we can ingrain these expectations into the way that we view life.

Once we develop certain personalities or identities related to our suffering it can become an intuitive part of who we are.


### The importance of ambition.


I suppose the real purpose of this article is to highlight the importance of having ambition in our lives.

With ambition we can adopt positive forms of struggling that can help us create and achieve things in our life as a definite precursor for happiness based in hard work and positive attitudes.

While happiness is largely a state of mind, that is not to say that we can entirely disconnect our feelings from reality itself and that having a positive sense of self-esteem is not vital for living in today’s society.

If we can manage to base our feelings in reality, rather than in the fantasies and egos of our mind, then we can have a much great connect with ourselves and who we truly are.

Ambition is incredibly important because the alternative is to suffer which carries a burden that even our curiosity cannot withstand.

People assume that there is some kind of middle ground, however the only static state of mind is death and that is naturally unwarranted.

Managing our happiness will always be a form of a struggle from the point of view of eastern philosophy, however it simply means that we must learn to master our struggle so that we can become effective and strong.

Struggle is important in the overall scheme of our own happiness because it a process of creating positive self-esteem which allows us greater opportunity in life.

One of the reasons why people end up becoming jaded is because they set their goals too high or they pursue an incorrect or simplified process as a way of trying to bypass struggle and in the end they simply allow themselves to struggle.

Mindfulness and critical thinking will always be important in everything we do and with the courage to approach and question the way we live our lives, we can surely benefit from the wisdom and perspective of those who have personally had success in their ambitions.
