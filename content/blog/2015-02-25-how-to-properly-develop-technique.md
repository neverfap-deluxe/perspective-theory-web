Technique is brilliant.

Technique is invaluable to figuring out how to do anything in life because it encompasses the most efficient process for us to learn or understand something. It helps to think of technique as the science of process.

We all have this great capacity within us to achieve and overcome our issues, yet without the knowledge or the proper technique, our efforts will be futile and weak.

Imagine trying to learn to play the piano using your feet or by standing 1 metre away from the piano. You simply wouldn’t be able to do it. With proper technique however, it is possible to play and learn the piano with ease.

Technique itself of course is merely one cog in a series of cogs. It helps us function, however technique alone will not save us. Without ambition, authority, enthusiasm, passion, and understanding, technique remains a tool for efficiency without purpose.

By understanding this idea of technique, not only can we focus on the process of overcoming our issues ahead, but we can give this process love and purpose which is what gives it consistency and strength.

This requires looking at the whole of the equation, rather than the individual parts. Without tying everything together, our hopes and dreams will only remain static and our technique

What we need to be focusing on is the process and the vision we create for ourselves, rather than individual aspects which give our visions and goals power. Without a solid understanding of reasons why we do something, we not only lack moral integrity however we also lack effective integrity.


### The problem with forcing technique.


Understanding is the key to discovering the drive behind our passions and motivations. Without understanding and embracing our drive and motivations, technique can never reach it's full potential.

I used to be able to play amazingly technical pieces on the saxophone in high school. I was able to play all the scales and sheet music with ease… yet in-spite of my talent, I never truly understood what music was.

It was all very mechanical to me. I doubt I even enjoyed playing music as it was something that was forced upon me by my mother. In a sense it was a purely technical exercise without soul.

I knew what melody was, however I did not care for what it meant nor how to create it. I was never able to improvise, only read music on a sheet. Naturally I have not played the saxophone since.

It helps to think of purpose as the underlying basis for technique.

If we do not have the appreciation, the desire or the motivation to want to succeed then we cannot fully take advantage of developing our talents, skills, goals and dreams through technique.


### Technique and purpose.


Purpose is what drives technique to be pure and efficient.

People only run into issues when they become nothing but the technique they derive. Instead they turn into emotionless robots. However as it is impossible for us to be unemotional, we become dysfunctional instead.

We feel horrible in lieu of goals we do not care about. We end up working against technique in order to brave through the things we hate and technique itself becomes a useless and harmful tool.

What’s important to understand is that concepts are easily corrupted if they are not taught without understanding and purpose.

Not only do we need to gain an appreciation of the things we do in life, however of the process required in order to get us to where our vision lives.

For a lot of people this is a matter of tantamount trial and error and that's perfectly fine. We are all guessing and trying to some degree.

What generally trips us and prevents us from appreciating our talents is that people get caught up in their past. These negative experiences form limiting beliefs in our mind and this gives technique a bad name.

In actual fact, it is because these experiences have tampered with our life purpose.

These are called limiting beliefs, because our passion itself is not limiting.

More often than not, it is life's fresh and exciting experiences that inspire us to relearn all the things we once used to love from the past.

One of the difficult aspects of life that we must come to grips with, is that we cannot force ourselves to love and have purpose. These are things born from understanding and technique is no different.

Technique is a by-product of circumstance, rather than of our sheer will. By changing our circumstances and understanding who we are, technique will simply follow. However the understanding always needs to come first.


### The importance of self-awareness.


This is precisely why self-awareness is vital for coming to terms with who we are so we can uncover these passions and ambitions in our lives.

It is incredibly difficult for us to understand ourselves when we are depressed and apathetic, which is why it’s important to start small and humble, as opposed to forcing technique and actions on ourselves which can very much make things worse.

Purpose does not come over night, however once you begin mastering your emotions and understanding how you are, your purpose will stay with you for as long as you desire.

Technique is an incredibly useful tool. However if we do not have the currently knowledge to utilise it, then we can only use it so far. We must first learn the basics.

Self-awareness can teach us these basics.
