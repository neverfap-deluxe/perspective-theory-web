Many of us struggle to find inspiration when we need it most.





We may have amazing ideas or dreams of who we want to be in our minds, and certainly we want to succeed in our lives and accomplish great things. Yet deep down inside we cannot quite commit ourselves to that first step of making it all happen.





The feeling is simply not there, even though our ideals are in place. We are convinced in our hearts, yet not quite convinced in our minds. It could be that the scope of our dreams are so large that they overwhelm us. Certainly there is a failure in our process. Yet how do we overcome this hurdle standing in the way of our goals?

When we struggle to inspire ourselves to attempt our dreams, our goals and aspirations can begin to feel like moral obligations, rather than things we actually feel like doing. It is as if we know that one day we will enjoy pursuing our dreams, yet we simply are not feeling it quite right now.




### ** Why we may not be inspired.**




If you are not inspired by your goals, then there is a large chance that you are not inspired by the process of obtaining these goals. A lot of people end up romanticising and idealising their goals and dreams without having properly embraced or understood the process.





This is not true inspiration. When we are attracted to the images and identity of things, once we begin glorifying our self-worth relative to our goals, then we are merely deluding ourselves and we will never be truly happy with our goals and purpose in life.





We only chase images and identities out of fear and insecurity. Inspiration is the opposite process, where we feel compelled because we truly enjoy doing them, because they motivate us to want to do better without making us feel inadequate at the same time.





Some people have become so cynical and accustomed to their own lives, that they believe there is no alternative to the grind of everyday life. They believe that life is inherently dull and difficult. This is the result of neglecting our potential for inspiration.


### **What is inspiration?**




It helps to take a closer look at what inspiration is, in order for us to overcome this dilemma.





Allow me to begin by saying that inspiration is a feeling we create within ourselves. It is a feeling of love and enjoyment for our own actions, not only of who we are today, but of who we aspire to become tomorrow.





Effective types of inspiration do not come from reading an inspiring quote online and immediately feeling enlightened. While quotes are certainly useful in helping us rediscover wisdom from the past that we can apply to our own lives, using them for inspiration is a false way of creating momentum. It merely provides us with an image or identity for us to glorify, while completely neglecting the process involved. This is in part why positive reinforcement does not work.





Instead, inspiration is a process of learning and understanding ourselves - about the things that truly motivate us to want to wake up in the morning. This is why understanding the process is fundamental.


### **How to create effective inspiration.**




Inspiration is something that comes from within. It is something we feel because living excites us. Effective inspiration is created from living inspiring lives and there are a few things we can do to help us get there.





Humans are impressionable. We find roller coasters terrifying, even though they are designed to be safe. They only seem dangerous because they feel terrifying and our feelings towards them are goals that function in the same manner. When we think about our own lack of inspiration, we realise that the logic is there, however the feeling is not.





However inspiration is more than just a feeling. It is primarily a method. As I mentioned earlier, it is a way of living our lives and I believe that effective inspiration relates back to the process of how this can inspire us.





Instead of looking at the end goal, it helps to focus on the journey - the living and experiencing in the present moment. When we watch documentaries examining phenomenon such as the great pyramids or the empire state building, they very rarely spend much time describing the structure. Instead, they talk about how these structures were built and the difficulty involved.





They do this because it is the journey that inspire us, not the end result. We want to find out about the story, not the mere title.





Taking the time to understand the process involved in achieving your goals is the best place to start with discovering inspiration. Not only does it make your goals seem a lot closer and more obtainable, but it's an honest and true way of examining your prospects of inspiration.
