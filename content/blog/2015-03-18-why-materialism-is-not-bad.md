There is this zen notion in modern society today that claims materialism is bad.

We are almost preached to on a daily basis that we should be at one with nature, consume less, live peacefully, amongst all the other cliches that have now become trivialised through the internet and our media.

While a lot of these virtues are certainly noble and though materialism may have the potential to become a negative influence in our lives, this article is not an attack on zen living, but rather a correction of all the exaggerations and distortions that have come through misunderstanding.

Obviously zen living is about reaching some sort of balance or harmony with nature, however there is nothing particularly wrong with the notion of materialism, only our preconceptions of what it is.

Ironically our consumerist society has latched onto this notion of anti-materialism through the projection of the minimalist designs and philosophies in the products we consume... at a seemingly increasing pace.

A lot of the notions we have of materialism for example, assume that our material possessions are indifferent to who we are as people - biological material. Yet what about the intellectual material in the thoughts of our mind? What is a healthy amount of material we should have in our lives?

We still need our clothes and a place for our shelter, however what anti-materialism does not address is the quality of our emotional well-being. After all, that is part of the reason why we buy and use things; for our own emotional and physical well-being.

Well, perhaps not.

I'm sure we've all been victim to the wonders of pulse purchasing and there can never be enough regret in owning something which you've never used in your entire life, let alone looked at.

Anti-materialism however and some of zen living's other aspects, have simply become a reaction to our rapidly advancing society where material and technology have become essential to assuring our efficiency and survival as a race.

Problems arise however when people allow these materials to take control of their lives and affect they way they feel and function, instead of focusing on the core of our emotional, mental and physical development as human beings.


### When materialism takes control.


Never in our lives have we had more choice in personalising our material, let alone in the variety of material available to us today.

The amount of intellectual material available on the internet is tremendous beyond our own capacities as we have entire complexes dedicating to selling tangible material, also known as shopping centres.

While this raw purchasing power has potential to form something brilliant in our lives, it tends to simply overwhelm us instead. We lose focus of the things in our life that are important and embrace the triviality of meaningless consumption.

What we want to do in place of this kind of materialism, is to use our materials so that they enhance our lives, passions and objectives, in ways that help us focus on our goals and ambitions.

In terms of the priority of our material, there is no substitute for our own body, including the thoughts we express in our mind.

So just ask yourself: How do these materials contribute towards your body and your mind? Do they have a positive or negative influence on these things?

Many of us try to live our lives through the objects and brands that we consume on a daily basis and in the process, we completely forget the spirituality and purpose of why we are consuming them in the first place.

This is why the core concepts of priority and focus are fundamental to our better understanding of materialism, not just for the materials that we have in our lives, but how we utilise them on a daily basis.


### Prioritising our focus.


In order to take control of our materialism and re-examine it's purpose, we need to dissolve all of our negative preconceptions of what materialism is.

Materialism is not a shallow and meaningless outlet of self-expression, it is simply another necessary facet of life. It is about how we connect and utilise it in our lives.

By changing our limiting beliefs, not only can we learn to accept materialism, but also embrace it as a useful and vibrant ideology in our lives.

We should constantly be discovering new ways in which we can create responsibility in our lives, rather than isolate ourselves along with our perceived limitations as individuals.

A crucial part of materialism is in our desire to keep and collect things. This is most prominent in the way we store and organise our memories from the past and how we create them in the present.

Much like our thoughts, our material possession can be thought of in the same way. There is no point focusing on and utilising the materials that we find pointless and obstructive in our own lives.

Through these practices, what we are trying to do is create choice in our lives so that we can focus on the possibility and not the limitation.

This is to help us recognise our behaviours and habits so we can be self-aware of who we are and how we relate to our material possessions. Which are the most important and necessary to our function? Which can we live without?

Through asking questions in a critical manner, we can discover more about ourselves, our thoughts and who we are.
