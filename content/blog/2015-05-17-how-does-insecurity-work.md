We all have days when we feel completely inadequate with ourselves.

We feel worthless as individuals, and we immediately envy other people’s circumstances as if their lives contain all the answers to our problems.

It is an inadequacy that makes us feel trapped within our own bodies. It is feeling of self-rejecting and confinement.

We feel condemned by our own sense of mediocrity and frustrated at the fact that we simply cannot switch bodies and lives with those who we perceive to be more ideal.

All of a sudden our partner no longer seems quite so attractive compared to the other couples we see floating about in public and our every thought seems mired in jealousy or neediness, like an agitation we simply cannot itch.

Thankfully these feelings are as easily maintained as they can be dismantled - a resolve for those seeking peace and acceptance.


### Why we fall into insecurity.


Insecurity is a notion or feeling caused by a failure to meet an expectation of who we should be.

That is to say that our perception of who we are in reality, differs from the ideas of who we should be in our mind and this disparity makes us feel inadequate with ourselves, along with the range of negative emotions it can provide.

This perception of who we should be could have been drilled into us through our parents’ self-criticism or even through our own expectations via what we have experienced in our own lives.

If these perspectives are strong enough, we can often form convincing narratives to validate the way that we feel about ourselves.

Our narratives are pervasive because they cause us not to question our circumstances and so they can trap us within our own insecurity.

For example if we truly believe that we are not thin enough or that we are not smart enough, then if truly buy into this narrative our circumstances can merely seem like a horrible consequence of our own existence, rather than a form of learned helplessness that we have adopted.

It is important to note that these mindsets and attitudes of insecurity are learned behaviours because we unconsciously reinforce them, even if we know that they are not in our best interest. One of the ways we do this is by using our feelings of guilt and shame to motivate us in our lives.

When we do not feel smart enough then naturally we will feel a drive us to spend more time improving on our intelligence.

The only issue is that our insecurities create unrealistic and exaggerated expectations which we cannot meet, so we inevitably feel self-defeated no matter how hard we try. As a way of combating this we merely decide to submit ourselves to self-criticism and guilt as a way to get us to try harder.

The reason why we choose not to dissolve our insecurity instead, is because of the narrative that holds it all in place. We do not question whether feeling guilty or shameful is the best way to achieve our goals - we merely automate these feelings into our psyche.

The problems are obvious. We end up needing more and more guilt to motivate us towards this unobtainable ideal that we have created in our minds. Eventually our guilt weighs so heavily that we give up, which naturally makes us feel worse and paralyses us further from taking any positive action.

Even once we do obtain our goals, we can begin to panic as our motivation for life fades, as feeling bad about ourselves has been the only way we know how to motivate ourselves. So naturally we either set the standards even higher or we find other ways to self-criticise and put ourselves down.

It is like we try and hopelessly balance our negative feelings in order to try and achieve outcomes. We want to feel guilty enough to move forward, but not so guilty that it completely paralyses it.

Some would call it insane.

Furthermore we allow these behaviours become habitual so that we end up subconsciously programming ourselves to self-harm without realising it.

This is also why our motivation can tend to crash and ride in cycles, because when we constantly paralyse ourselves with guilt. We need to finally wait a few weeks until we can finally find the courage to start again and pursue the grind.

It is why people get turned off their ambitions and end up becoming cynical about life and those people who are successful. It is a very dangerous and harmful way of living our lives.


### Living our lives with passion.


When we remain within these cycles of insecurity, it can literally become all we know.

The alternative instead is to live with passion and to live without expectation of who we should be. This means to motivate ourselves without fear or worry - but because we actually want to.

I personally thought it was all a load of hogwash, however now I literally wake up and I really, really want to accomplish things and be the best version of myself. I no longer feel any amount of shame or guilt in anything I do and most importantly, it has opened up so many new opportunities that I otherwise would have avoided.

In order to overcome our insecurities we need to truly understand the nature of why we feel insecure which is something that comes from understanding, studying and practicing self-awareness and discovering perspective.

From the moment of my recovery, it took me roughly one year for me to come to terms with all my fears and insecurities from the beginning of my journey, though we all move at a different pace.

One of the most effective things that we can do for our insecurities is to simply observe them and become aware of how we act when we are feeling them the most.

While it may seem pointless, the idea is to get ourselves to become consciously aware of our behaviours, which is the main reason why we get away with our negative habits.

Often when we are stuck in a mindset of excessive insecurity we can fail to truly think about what is actually going on in our minds. We allow our insecurities to flourish because we put ourselves on autopilot without question or action.

Instead we believe that we are simply broken by design.

With perspective and self-awareness there are a lot of different ways that we dissolve the images in our mind and learn to live in the present moment.
