A thought: we relate to the world through the stories and narratives we create in our mind.

Just about everything has a narrative that we convey, such as the narrative behind our wedding ring or even the very emotions that we captivate us on a daily basis.

Narratives are important because they give meaning and purpose to the thoughts and emotions that transpire in our mind.

While emotions and thoughts can obviously be effective on their own, narratives help us cement our feelings into a coherent structure.

Imagine a movie with nothing more than a bunch emotional thrills and scares (yes Michael Bay, I am staring firmly at you.) While it would be effective in providing some sort of experience, it would be largely a superficial and forgettable experience.

In essence our narratives make everything feel real and convincing. Furthermore, we all have a number of different narratives to fulfil our different moods at attitudes, that we often rotate and cycle through.

Take the time to think about the way in which we create narrative in our own lives, simple through the words and pictures that we record through our blogs and phones.

What kind of a story are you trying to tell? What is the narrative of your life? Are you the cool jock or the elusive literature nerd?


### Abusing narratives.


While there is nothing inherently wrong with utilising narratives, the primary issue is that our narratives can be easily fabricated to the point of trapping us within our own emotions.

While our narratives are largely designed to support our emotions, sometimes we can exaggerate our narratives with such complexity and belief that they end up reinforcing our emotions against our will.

Our narrative can suggest that we should deservedly feel guilty or horrible about ourselves because of a story that we are not good enough or because we are helpless to change.

When we truly believe and invest in these self-defeating narratives they can feel real and convincing to the point where we do not question them.

To make things even more difficult for ourselves, we can have multiple self-defeating narratives that trap us within our own mindset.

For example when we breakup with a loved one we can have a narrative that expresses sadness for now being single, but also a narrative that makes us angry for ever being in such a dysfunctional relationship, not to mention the narrative of guilt for ever breaking up with someone we once and may still love.

When we feel confused and depressed, we can end up circling between these self-defeating narratives forever and feel as if we are going nowhere.

While I am sure we have all experienced these kinds of narratives in the past, perhaps from a family member passing away or if we have lost our job, it is fundamental to understand that there is nothing wrong with having narratives and that they are normal and natural.

It is just when we take our narratives far beyond their utility that we end up harming ourselves unnecessary.


### Why we construct narratives.


Truth is that humans love to play characters.

We tend to mimic the lifestyles of celebrities and other famous people as a way of feeling special and elusive with the way we live our lives.

We wear certain clothes and establish ourselves with certain brands as a way of living through these characters and the way we hold it altogether is through the narratives that we have created through the images, beliefs, thoughts and emotions that we express on a daily basis.

Of course these narratives are mere stories, and once we become obsessed we can begin to take them so seriously and exaggerate them to the point of affecting everything in our lives, from our self-worth to our expectations of the future.

Instead of using these narratives for fun or for support meaningful goals and ambitions, we instead spiral into a state of insecurity and obligation. We end up feeling as if we need to maintain these narratives in order to feel authentic or even positive about ourselves.

In many cases it can mean becoming someone who we do not truly feel comfortable with - as insecurity can never accept who we are, so much as it forces us into feeling inadequate so that we constant feel like we must change.

Without attempting to change the narrative that we play in our mind, we cannot hope to have any sort of positive influence in dismantling and coming to terms with our insecurities and egos. The good news is that these stories are generally fallible and they are just as easy to render real as they are to render fake.

This really highlights the true beauty of perspective - it simply comes down to working with the mechanisms of the mind to change the way we think and feel.


### Maintaining a sense of standard.


I am sure many of us a vague idea of who we are.

How often do you actually take the time to think about who you are? Do you believe in a certain standard that you must maintain each day, such as a level of grooming or fashion sensibility? Would you feel uncomfortable with yourself if you did not maintain this standard?

In most cases we tend to do it subconsciously as a way of dealing with who we are materially. We create these descriptions of ourselves to help identify ourselves as part of society.

The main reason why we create these narratives is to satisfy the perceptions that we believe society has of us, rather than who we actually are.

Of course society is a very vague word. In essence our egos or identities make us self-conscious of who we are and how we are being perceived, whether it be from ourselves form other individuals.

When our egos and identities become so strong, we never feel as if we are truly alone - even if we actually are alone in a room to ourselves. We constantly feel judged and insecure about ourselves,  because we believe in these narratives that dictate a false sense of reality.

On the other hand true peace and content with oneself does not require any expectations of who we should be.


### Dissolving the narrative.


Even if we believe that there is nothing wrong with our narratives, simply becoming aware and identifying the narratives that we play in our mind can do wonders for helping us come to terms with ourselves and better understand who we are.

The interesting thing is that once we become aware of ourselves and our actions, our narratives tend to become less effective at exaggerating the way we feel.

This is not to say that our narratives will completely dismantle to the point of becoming a nihilistic utopia, however we simply derive our sense of realism from having clarity and wisdom, rather than from insecurity and fantasy.

In other words, our narratives are only effective as the faith we put into them which is why questioning our narratives is a superb way of dismantling them.

Of course, self-awareness is not some kind of ultimate epiphany that cannot be reversed. We can just as easily return back into a state of delusion, no matter how aware we once were.

A large part of changing these attitudes is about adopting points of view and practices of acceptance and peace. Meditation is particularly wonderful and exposing ourselves to nature can often open up new ways of thinking and appreciating life.

The ultimate goal of dissolving our narratives is to allow ourselves to live within the moment where we have more control over how we choose to live our lives, whether that be with clarity or even in fantasy.
