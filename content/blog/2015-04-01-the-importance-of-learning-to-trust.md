Trust is vital for our own mental health.

Without trust we simply cannot function. We become paranoid to the point of isolating ourselves from any amount of co-operation and this can even lead us to lose trust of ourselves in our emotions, feelings and beliefs.

We end up creating so much fear and insecurity through our lack of trust that it ends up paralysing us completely. We feel lost, confused and trapped at the same time.

Trust is more than just confidence. Many people think that if we simply develop a sense of confidence in ourselves by putting on a fearless attitude, that we can somehow learn to develop trust.

Unfortunate this sort of view point can only bring us to develop masks and identities in order to deal with our fears and insecurities. It is not an effective solution.

Trust can be thought of a belief that is reflected in our feelings and emotions. These beliefs usually derive from the trauma we have experienced, reinforced by our thoughts and emotions.

When our emotional reactions are particularly strong and negative, they can impact on the way we feel and eventually mould into what we believe.

To make matters worse, continually experiencing this trauma reinforces our beliefs through the feelings and emotions that are being validated. To cope we learn to distort and generalise the assumptions in our beliefs so to protect us from further emotional pain.

In essence we manipulate and condition our own beliefs in order to control our reaction to trauma.

Unfortunately it is also makes us incredibly fragile and allows ourselves to become even more easily manipulated and conditioned into the future.

As you may tell, none of these conditions allow us to develop trust, however trust is imperative to ensure our success and function as human beings.


### Why trust is important.


Trust is the fabric for any amount of function.

We obviously need to have a certain amount of trust in our lives; the trust in our arms that they will still work when we wake up in the morning or the trust we have of the floor for not collapsing in on us.

When you remove this trust, our assumptions of the world implicated in our beliefs change as well and this can cause us to believe in an unrealistic and dishonest version of reality.

Honesty is important because it gives us control over our reality. Without being open and honest, we cannot truly hope to and interpret our personality to change it in line with our goals and ambitions.

Living in fear and insecurity is an ineffective way to live our lives, as I’m sure even those without trust are aware. The issue is that being trapped in this mindset we can make us feel like we have no choice in our lives to change.

We all have the capacity to dissect, reinterpret and change our beliefs. Thankfully the brain is incredibly malleable in terms of how it develops and retains information, so there is always hope.

It may not be personally easy, however it is never too late to regain trust in ourselves and of others, especially if we believe that our mental health is a priority.

If we can understand the details of our beliefs, unhinge the false assumptions predicated in our logic and detaching ourselves from our emotions - then we already more than halfway there to meeting our goals and all these things can become easily achievable with enough context and understanding.

One of the hardest aspects for those who have lost trust in their lives, is that they also lose a lot of function as a result and this makes it difficult to apply strategies and processes to their lives.

This includes in their own ability to regain trust in themselves and as well as the ideas and concepts of perspective and self-awareness.

Unfortunately there is no easy answer, however there are small things we can do like practice gratitude amongst other self-awareness exercises, to help us slowly to regain control of ourselves. Of course everyone has their own limiting beliefs which require different perspectives to overcome.

This is part of the reason why I suggest people should assume that everything they know about themselves and their depression is wrong, to give themselves a fresh start that is not held down by our own personal attitudes and biases. Humility is also known to work as an effective equaliser.

Trust is difficult topic because it can become a detrimentally self-reinforcing cycle, which feeds itself with fear, self-doubt and insecurity. There is no easy answer, other than to take baby steps and discover some sort of perspective in your lives.

No matter our challenges however, there is always hope for us to gain and draw from. We are literally surrounded by inspiration - we merely have to find it and call it our own, in-spite of the seeming confusion.


### There is no solution in fear.


We view the world through the lens of fear in our distrust because it comforts us with the familiarity of our beliefs as well as because it validates our own experience with our beliefs, regardless of whether these beliefs agitate us or make us feel physically sick.

The main problem with fear and insecurity is that it does nothing to empower us. It merely aims to limit our power and influence so that we can avoid these emotional reactions.

All this does is narrow our potentially to experience emotional pain (as well as emotional pleasure) without truly addressing the cause of our insecurity and fear, which derives from our inability to trust.

Thankfully by regaining trust in our lives, we can learn and develop much more effective ways to deal with our trauma.

Instead of maintaining our limiting beliefs, we can learn to own and take responsibility over them. We can learn to change and dissolve our limiting beliefs and learn to embrace our emotions and thoughts instead.

Learning to cope and protect ourselves using identities and insecurities may seem like a good idea at the time and often it is because we cannot devise any other way to deal with it.

However through self-awareness and perspective we can learn to develop a true sense of confidence that will not only allow us to become open and honest in our lives, but also give us the tools and strength avoid any kind of inflicted emotional pain.
