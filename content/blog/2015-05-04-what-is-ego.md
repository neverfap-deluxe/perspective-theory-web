While ego is incredibly easy to describe, it can be very difficult to understand and empathise with.

When we want to try and fully understand an idea, it is not as simple as merely taking the time to accustom ourselves with theory.

Self-awareness and perspective are skills that we need to practice on a daily basis so that we can truly empathise with the ideas which can help our mental illness. What makes empathy so difficult, especially in the context of our own ego, is that we do not have the direct ability switch between different conscious minds.

Instead, we are stuck within our own mind and body, along with all the typical emotional and logical responses that we experience on a daily basis. This is to say that it can be incredibly difficult to experience other points of view that are not our own.

We are mostly limited to imagining and generalising other points of view from what we have personally experienced in life.

This is particularly problematic if we have remained cynical and depressed for as long as we can remember, so optimistic and empowering points of views can be a struggle - especially when we need them most. One of the consequences is that people can end up reinforcing existing negative thinking patterns through the guise of enlightenment and end up deluding themselves further.

Thankfully, self-awareness and perspective give us  tools to better empathise with something we have not readily experienced, or may not truly understand.


### How does our ego function?


The ego, our identity, serves as a way to keep our reality coherent and consistent with our own beliefs.

Think of it as a collection of the ideals and beliefs we have which assist us in everyday function.

It is a very efficient way of organising the way we think and feel about ourselves, however the trade off is that we end up sacrificing our ability to act effectively.

Instead of thinking for ourselves and adapting to our circumstances, we retain to the ideals of our identity consisting of our beliefs, understandings and thoughts of the world. It is ineffective because we must always be congruent with our identity, otherwise we end up suffering emotionally and logically.

If we fail to be that 'cool alternative hipster with the nice clothes' then we end up judging and self-criticising ourselves for not meeting our expectations as individuals.

Of course, our insecurities are easily manipulated and distorted and so we find all sorts of reasons to judge ourselves and feel guilty.

As you can imagine, this is a very static way of understanding how life works. Embracing our identity does not prepare us for all the dynamic changes that happen around us.

Most importantly, it limits us in what we can hope to achieve and experience in life.

It may be that we could really enjoy and be good at playing the Saxophone, however we perceive it as something that is uncool, naturally we are not going to pursue these outlets.

We do this in part because of the false sense of security and purpose that our identities provide to us.

When we generalise and assume what is right or wrong in the grand scheme of our identity, it feeds our sense of self-worth with ideas of what it should be - when in reality, these are things which have no definition.

This is why we become insecure relative to our ego, because they are made up fears that have no consistent basis - only on the faulty assumptions and generalisation we create in our mind.

As our identity is largely subconscious, a lot of our insecurities and self-criticisms and fears also remain subconscious and it is not until they become an issue do we even realise they are there.

Of course, the ego is not the primary issue. We are always going to have some kind of identity based on assumptions and generalisations.

The issue is based in how we reinforce our ego by not being aware of our behaviours that we exhibit so that once they do become exaggerated, we feel helpless and out of control to our own detriment.


### Learning to dissolve the ego.


When we talk about dissolving the ego, it is not that we are trying to completely dissolve ourselves down to the very atoms that we represent.

What we are trying to do is to break down the ego’s components (our beliefs, attitudes, thoughts, emotions) so that we can become conscious of them and subsequently understand and realise who needs changing.

One of the great fears of those currently suffering from delusion (which represents an exaggerated and distorted sense of ego) is that they feel worried about becoming aware of themselves.

They worry it would expose the horrors of their own existence, as if the innocence of remaining unaware is a barrier which serves to protect them. Yet these are merely notions of fear that we create as an extension of our unconscious exaggeration.

When you think about it, very little changes once you do become aware of ego. There is this idea that become aware will affect our capacity to experience reality, yet our capacity never changes - only our perception can.

Our problems literally remain as they are, as do our arms and legs. Literally none of our capacities as a human beings change. The only difference is that we now have clarity in how we want to think.

Of course many people fear having this option because it then gives them a sense of responsibility that they must fulfil and it is something that they have been desperately trying to avoid.

It is a vicious cycle, because part of the reason why we feel depressed is because we consciously know that we are being dishonest with ourselves.

We know on some level that we are merely trying to get away from our problems, which simply makes us feel more self-conscious about the consequences of our actions.

This is good because it demonstrates that there is hope. It demonstrates that we understand to some degree that our actions have consequences.

If we break down these actions into an easy to follow process, then it can help us break down the barrier of overcoming our mental illness and particularly, help us become more aware of ourselves.


### Embracing self-awareness.


In reality, it is very rare that people exist unaware of their circumstances.

When we see movie stars or celebrities or successful people in our lives it gives us an impression of effortlessness or ease.

This is only because we buy into the identity that they project, rather than the reality of the hard work that happens behind the scenes.

It is the kind of hard work which we are all capable of, if only we develop our lives in a way that is reflective of being aware of our behaviours, rather than neglectful of them.

The reason why awareness is so important and prevalent in those who are successful, is because it gives us the power to choose and change who we are. This is to say that awareness gives us focus and direction in our lives, rather than the kind of insecurity and false self-projection that adopting identity provides.

When we live within our ego, we have no effective control over ourselves. Instead we need to adapt to a world that is dynamic and changing by becoming these ideals ourselves.

When we remain trapped within our own shell and the world changes without us, we can suffer and reject ourselves of experiencing the wonders of opportunity.
