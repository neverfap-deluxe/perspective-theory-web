Finding self-awareness can be difficult.

If we remain in a state of delusion or denial for a long period of time, we can sometimes feel as if they are the only ways to express ourselves effectively or with any degree of confidence.

We can feel that remaining guilty and self-critical is easier and more comfortable than learning to become self-aware.

<!-- more -->

This because we allow our limitations to define us by focusing on what we cannot do, rather than the kind of opportunities that our good behaviours can provide us with.

For example, when we go on a diet that requires we only eat certain types of food, the idea that we cannot eat the unhealthy foods we love make us feel restricted and trapped. All it takes is a moment of anxiety or for a second thought for us to plunge into doubt and resume our bad behaviours.

The issues are numerous. Not only does it demonstrate a failure to maintain perspective, however it also shows that we do not have focus or direction in our perspective. When we focus on the opportunity of our situation, we no longer feel trapped by our actions. Instead we feel empowered by our potential of the kinds of positive things we can achieve.

Furthermore, when we truly focus on the opportunity our goals and ambitions can feel effortless, rather than as a chore.

In order to achieve this we need to do more than just live healthy lives. We also need to change our perspective so that we enjoy every moment, rather than only selective aspects of our lives.


### Why we pursue self-awareness.


One obvious reason why we choose to expose the denial and guilt in our lives through self-awareness is because our current lifestyles are simply not working out for us.

In many cases it is because we tend to take things to the extreme.

When we become addicted we cannot simply become mildly addicted - we must become consumed with addiction. We have a hard time not taking things personally and when we become depression, we literally sink into the middle of the earth with sadness.

It seems that we have an easy time losing sight of ourselves and our purpose in life.

Thankfully through self-awareness and perspective, we can just about eliminate the extremity of these behaviours so that we can maintain control over our lives.

I say this as someone who was all those things - an excessively depressed, overly-opinionated, addict.  Thankfully I have largely overcome these challenges in my life which means that you can too.

We all have different reasons why we want to become self-aware or at least achieve this ideal in our mind, however I think for a lot of people it is because they believe that there is still hope in their lives to get better and not just better - however completely rid of their depression once and for all.


### The secret to maintaining perspective.


The fact is that there is no secret to becoming self-aware.

This is because self-awareness is a process of discovery that differs from person to person. Furthermore, everyone requires different perspectives to help them understand their issues more clearly.

There are a lot of things we can do however to change the way we feel about our choices in our lives and particularly, breaking down our thoughts/feelings can help tremendously.

When you do have episodes of desire or feeling like you are under limitation, do you tend to focus on the way you feel or the thoughts running rampant in your mind?

One of the issues that people have is that they tend to become overwhelmed by the the excess of their thoughts and emotions that they simply do not know how to respond.

All they think in their mind is how to immediately put an end to the suffering, which usually means going to their bad habits where they can subdue their emotions.

Even worse is when people begin to bargain or try and reason with their emotions and thoughts, yet this merely consolidates the paradigm of our suffering, to the point that giving in may seem like the only sensible option.

The main thing to remember is that the reason why we have episodes of depression is because we have not properly maintained perspective.

When we are having episodes of anxiety or depression, it is very difficult to steer the wheel once we have lost control and so perspective is largely about prevention, rather than immediate fixes to our problems.

Though there are always small things we can do like not take our emotions personally, however without a solid emotional and logic foundation for our recovery it can be very difficult to change.

With a solid emotional foundation, we do not need to rely on our easily corruptible logic to make up for our inadequate feelings and vice versa. While self-awareness is amazing at assisting us with our lives, it is certainly not a replacement for living a healthy and meaningful life itself. The two need to work together.

This is why it is vital that we learn to have the courage to do what is necessary, rather than do what we think is arbitrary or is an easy way out to our problems.


### Embracing self-awareness and perspective.


Self-awareness is not a limitation as long as we view it as opportunity and it is a new point of view that takes getting used to. It can become difficult to maintain this point of view when our emotions are out of whack, however that is simply part of the learning curve of self-awareness.

Of course, focusing on the small things that we can do on a daily basis is going to help us the most to adjust to this new perspective.

Maintaining self-awareness is something which does not happen without work. Like any other skill, we are bound to fail a countless number of times, though improvement can be expected over the long haul.

Self-awareness is not like a switch that simply activates in our mind and stays on. It is more like an adjustment to emotional and logical stability through the slowly process of learning and adapting to our circumstance.

Our neural patterns do not change immediately, however once they do, it will be a lot harder to return back to our old habit.

At the end of the day it comes down to finding what works for us, in a way that is not mired in denial or self-destructive behaviours and self-awareness and perspective can help us achieve these goals.
