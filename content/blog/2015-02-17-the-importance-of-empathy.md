Empathy is one of the hardest skills for us to learn.

It’s difficult because it requires making assumptions beyond what we can actually feel and know. We can never really truly empathise with others, since we do not directly have their point of view.

Empathy often requires taking someone else's word for what they're feeling, even if it sounds bizarre or delusional. It is about truly wanting to understand something we currently feel foreign to.

More often than not, it is ourselves that we struggle the most to empathise with. We feel foreign to ourselves. We do not understand who we are and we even feel disconnected.

Empathy in a sense is actually a lot of different skills put together. Empathy is a concept, an ideal and there are many ways we can achieve it within ourselves and others.


### When empathy becomes arrogance.


I try to accomplish empathy on this website by trying not to be biased in my observations. The end goal is to remain ultimately neutral and without judgment.

Empathy is a facet that always strives for the honesty. In this honesty is truth and in truth, expose the underlying false assumptions that we have of ourself.

I do not always accomplish this and part of the reason is because of the arrogance that ego can take hold.

Arrogance is a sort of euphoria that’s driven by our identity and egos. It’s incredibly easy to place our emotions and feelings behind our identities, and we often do it because it’s easy.

We feel high and mighty when we get a date and begin putting our self-worth into this notion that we can get dates, but then the moment we are rejected or dates do not turn out as planned, it breaks us.

This is why it’s important to always have acceptance, because it prevents us from deceiving ourselves by reminding us of our vulnerability and humility. It brings us back down to reality.


### Understanding our vulnerability.


It’s important to remind ourselves of our vulnerabilities, because it is another side as to why we misunderstand ourselves.

People who are suffering from depression are generally quite agitated. The incessant judgment and self-criticism, the feelings of worthlessness, the general hopelessness of life - it is like being picked at constantly by guilt, shame and our emotions.

As the agitation grows, it simply learns to overcome us and after a while, we just give up entirely and shut ourselves down. We find it a lot easier not to think at all, rather than put up with the pain, which is their version of legitimately trying.

This is a failure to accept, though certainly no one’s fault. Acceptance is a very difficult skill to understand, especially when you are depressed.

Instead of accepting, we decide to fight who we are instead. The issue is that our logic will always tend to win at the end of the day and logic itself neither has to be linear, nor even rational.


### Learning empathy.


We create the logic in our minds that our judgments will set us free, even though they are limitations by design. We set ourselves up for failure from the beginning, yet because we have such faith in our beliefs - we remain blind to the cause of our emotional suffering.

As you can see, empathy is not a simple concept. It requires a true understanding of the way the mind processes our beliefs, thoughts and feelings. Of course, I’ve merely attempted to explain an entire year’s worth of findings and epiphanies within a short 1000-word article, so naturally it is not easy.

However little by little, we can learn to adopt and practice these skills, by engraining this knowledge into our minds.
