Many of us misunderstand the process of self-understanding.

Some of us assume that we can only reach a certain level of self-understanding and that after this point, there is nothing left to discover. In reality self-understanding a process that never ends, which can always be improved upon and tweaked.

Others do not bother to self-understanding, living with the premise that they are just the way they are and that the act of self-understanding is futile at most. Many people have simply been burnt in the past after much frustration and no progress with trying to gain any sort of insight into their lives.

It is a tough gig. How can one understand who they are if they do not inherently have this understanding? In most cases we come up with a maze of elaborate theories to try and explain our behaviour, which always turns out to be wrong and which even extends our lack of understanding.

I believe that our lack of curiosity into self-understanding however relates more deeply to our fears and insecurities about what we may discover or understand about ourselves. We fear letting go of our depression.

We gain the fear that we cannot trust ourselves. We become attached to this belief and it moulds our attitude about who we think we are. We avoid asking the important questions in our lives that need asking.

This is completely understandable and to be expected, yet without this self-understanding we cannot hope to truly and effectively change who we are.


### Empathising with our fears.


We have two great fears as people that prevent us from trying.

Of course, these do not come across as fears in our mind. They come across as concrete beliefs predicated upon solid logic. The way we dissolve these beliefs is to expose ourselves to their faulty logic, so that they appear as irrational, rather than logic in our mind.

It is also important for us to manage our emotions and disassociate from the way our beliefs make us feel.

Firstly, we fear that we will lose a part of who we are if we were to become happy and free of depression. Secondly, we fear that we simply do not have the power to change who we are.

We worry that managing our depression will fundamentally change us as people, that we will never be depressed again and that our life experience will be fundamentally changed by the limitations of happiness and joy.

We almost associate happiness with becoming dull and boring.

When we are depressed, we experience such a range of sadness that it seems complex to us. Yet rarely do we experience a wide range of happiness, simply due to our depression. Happiness and the range of positive emotions becomes this foreign spectrum to us, so we feel that it is shallow.

Ultimately it is impossible to dissolve the depressive aspect of our personality. Our mind is a holistic system of a wide range of emotions and feelings and it is impossible to block these aspects without using drugs or surgery.

On the other hand if we can learn to change the logic in our mind with perspective, then we can choose which aspects of our personality we which to adopt. We can prevent ourselves from being paralysed by helplessness and victimisation.

We often deny ourselves the opportunity of alternate thinking to depression, partly because we believe that there is no alternative and that constant depression is the only way of life.

This is another example of pure fear disguised as truth and it is fear that we believe to be honest and true.

Of course, there is nothing wrong with fear, however we have issues when we believe that fear itself carries more weight that trust. What is one any different than the other if they are both just created from a different combination of chemicals in our brain?

In actual fact, fear is just another form of trust. We choose to trust our limiting beliefs more than we do with empowering beliefs.

As long as we commit ourselves to these limiting beliefs and commit to them with our trust and power, we will always feel hopeless and unmanageable.


### Changing our attitudes towards our beliefs.


One of the ways in which we can help change this attitude towards our limiting beliefs is by understanding the structure of them.

Once we realise that our limiting beliefs actually take a lot of effort and faith to uphold, then it no longer feels so much like an obligation. They feel more like efforts, like burdens in our mind.

This is why it is important to address the bad and false logic in our thinking, so that we can dissolve our delusions and live with more honest and less sufferable interpretations.

More often that not people act with the intention of self-understanding, resulting however in even more confusion and disassociation.

I was certainly culprit to this process of trial and error. I spent years clashing over entirely different and harmful theories about who I was and what I was capable of, however with a lot of persistence, I am now comfortable with who I am.

I largely learnt to be self-aware, not by my own accord, but from reading about other people’s experiences and books regarding their own depression and self-awareness. In other cases we come up with our own epiphanies, usually drawn from the context of what we have read or shared with another person.

Not all knowledge will relate to us, but the knowledge that does is invaluable to us. One small sentence can prevent a lifetime of suffering, simply in the vital message of understanding it conveys.

So how can we properly understand who we are, without running into bumps along the way? We can't; but like a child learning to walk, it is noble process that is a vital part of a growing up.


### The search for truth.


As part of our personality and our beliefs, we have this specific idea of what the truth is. This truth is a belief within itself and is not necessarily honest, but an entirely personal point of view.

Of course, why would we want to have beliefs if they were wrong? Either they are emotionally or logically consistent and as long as this is the case, our beliefs will always feel real and believable to us.

The process of self-understanding is to always question this truth and to be skeptical and critical of it’s qualities. As long as your truth is predicated upon fear, then it will always be dishonest and this will be a reflection of the way you live your life.

Our fears and limiting beliefs serve to protect this truth. When we are deluded, it is because we choose to actively defend our truth, rather than expose the dishonesty and dysfunction beneath the exterior.

We do this by having principles, values and virtues in which we hope to uphold. From there we can more easily try and dissect and expose the bad logic in our beliefs.

Ultimately if we are to learn to be self-aware, we must live in the present moment which will allow us to observe, examine and understand our common behaviours.

If we are living in the world of our fears and limiting beliefs, then we can only continue to delude ourselves.
