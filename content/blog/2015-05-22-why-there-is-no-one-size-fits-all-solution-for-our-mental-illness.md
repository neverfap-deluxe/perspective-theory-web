It would be fair to say that I have come a long way with my mental health.

I find it interesting to contemplate on the challenges of overcoming my mental illness because it is apparent that even though I understand how to be functional, the very core of my mental illness has not changed.

It is merely through perspective and self-awareness that I have discovered strategies and points of view which cleverly circumvent my mental illness from affecting my mood, thoughts, and emotions.

I suppose what intrigues me the most is my extraordinary capacity for dysfunction and how truly dysfunctional I used to be before I discovered different perspectives in my life.

Not only by the range of negative and self-defeating perspectives that I used to adopt in my thoughts and emotions, however also by the intensity and duration with which they used to fluctuate each day.

Some days I would be feeling incredibly self-critical, other days trapped in a state of helplessness, other days paralysed with guilt and some days impressionable to the point of complete envy and jealousy.

I suppose the point is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for managing our mental health.

When you think about all the horrible combinations of mental illness that can strike us in any one moment, some strategies can work really well in some situations while others can merely exacerbate the way we feel for the worst.


### How we exacerbate our mental illness.


A lot of our frustrations with mental illness have a lot to do with the way that we perceive the complexity of our issues.

When the intensity and variety of our mental issues overwhelm us so frequently and rapidly, we can simply come to the conclusion that it is too difficult and almost impossible to try and front-run or change our behaviours.

The issue is that people try to assume that mental illness is this linear process that can be predicted every-time, when in reality it is an intricate and holistic ecosystem of perspectives and interpretations which are best viewed at a case-by-case basis.

This is why this website offers so many different articles because I hope to cover a wide range of perspectives so that we can best empathise with our issues.

Certainly over time I have noticed that some strategies and systems can work flawlessly in certain situations, only to be completely ineffective in others.

This is part of the reason why I promote perspective and self-awareness because it does not function as a system so much as it functions as a complex understanding of how best to discover solutions in our lives.

That is to say that self-awareness is not a one-size-fits-all template so much as it is a process of honest self-discovery that aims to understand the process behind our dysfunction, rather than treat it like a wound that can be fixed with a band-aid.

It is only if we deny this process of self-discovery that people generally obscure their recovery by assuming a number of false expectations of what they personally think mental illness is.


### What is perspective really about?


It is important to understand that while I write with a lot of confidence and structure, my intention is not to try and provide you with direct solutions to your problems.

While some of my writings may be accurate in this sense, viewing perspective and self-awareness as a direct solution is contrary to what our recovery is about.

Recovering from mental illness is largely about learning to think for ourselves and what our mental illness means to us and the best way we can do this is through self-discovery.

My articles attempt to provide you with ideas of how best to approach your mental health, as everyone has different problems and different causes of their mental illness.

I suppose I compare it to the same vein of looking up recipe ideas online.

Half the time we are merely searching for inspiration of what to cook and furthermore, having a recipe does not mean that we will be able to cook the dish well.

Each recipe has a different way of trying to describe how to cook even the same dish and so that is why we tend to look at variety of different recipes for inspiration.

A lot of the time we may not even have all the ingredients for what we want to cook and so we end up improvising and substituting ingredients that best suit our needs.

Ultimately the point I am trying to get at is that we need to be creative with our mental health and not try and think that it is some kind of hard science with exact procedures.

There are noÂ easy or direct solutions for overcoming our mental illness and there certainly are no systems or trains of thought that are infallible or entirely immune from disruption.

There are always going to be challenges that require us to find the courage to move beyond our own circumstances and this is one of many qualities that self-awareness cannot teach.

This is why perspective is so important for us to decipher ways of how best to overcome our mental illness.


### Learning to be creative with our solutions.


While there is a lot that we can do for our recovery in the long run, such as changing actively changing our cognitive processes, I personally find that the small epiphanies we discover each day are most helpful at empowering us to move forward.

Inevitably we are always going to have bad days during our recovery however the trick is to continue discovering new and different perspectives in our lives so that we can come to terms with the way we feel, as well as effectively change our behaviours as well.

One of the false assumptions that people have of self-awareness is that it is this constant stream of conscious awareness that provides us with infinite wisdom like some sort of immunity totem that prevents us from experiencing emotional pain.

This is merely a glorified stereotype that is counter-productive to what effective mental health should be about: a conscious and functioning understanding of the world.

Effective self-awareness is about helping us uncover, expose and become aware of our bad habits as a means of changing them, rather than serve as a point of focus and distraction.

This really emphasises the use of self-awareness and perspective as tools to help us in our quest for self-discovery, rather than the kind of quick-fix solutions which people inherently seek instead.

This is why learning to think critically and for ourselves is vital for making our recovery successful.
