Motivation is a wonderful thing.

It makes us feel as if we have all the drive and energy in the world. It makes us want to grow and develop and become more noble people.

The only issue is that some of us can have difficulty maintaining this motivation. It can be frighting to be highly motivated for weeks at a time, only to find out next morning that life is a complete bewildering mystery to us all.

There are a number of reason why we can lose motivation, however it is more important to focus on the factors that keep us motivated, rather than others that us.

That is because motivation does not truly disappear. Losing motivation is a slow process that happens over time if we do not maintain it, however feels sudden when it eventually topples us over.

For a lot of us, especially people suffering from constant depression, motivation can be a rare facet in our lives and this can cause us to become naive or arrogant with our own feelings. It can feel overwhelming once we experience stability for the first time in months, and it can create the impression that we have overcome our illness indefinitely. This causes us to act in deep disregard to our mental health.

Once we inevitably crash and lose our motivation again, we can sink into an even deeper depression and feel even more hopeless than we were to begin with.

It is a cycle of depression we can find ourselves all too often in, mired in a perpetual chase between guilt and shame. If this cycle repeats itself often enough, we can simply create the expectation that we are incapable of anything greater than our own instability.

This is one of the reasons why people with mental illness experience the highs and lows of their mood without question - they simply misinterpret their own experience with their own mental capacity and continue to perpetrate their own actions.

In actual fact, our motivation is very simple to understand and once we get it right, we open ourselves to a world of infinite possibility. It only seems perplexing if we do not know what we are doing, which can be easily taught.


### Understanding the basics.


A large reason why we lose motivation is because we do not stick to the basics.

More importantly, if we do not know what the basics are, then we effectively leave our motivation to misconception or blind luck.

If we are doing things that are not conducive to our motivation, then naturally we will not be motivated. It is a simple matter of understanding the consequences of our actions.

Instead of relying on confidence based in positive self-esteem, people can instead use fear, judgment and self-criticism as a way to compel themselves to act.

This is a sure-way to create failure and emotional suffering in our lives.

Another common problem people have is that they create temporary feelings of confidence which is not derived from hard work and positive habits.

These feelings give us the impression of being long lasting when they are only temporary, which makes us feel even more confused once our motivation fails us once again.

This is why effective motivation is so important because it can allow us to remain stable while pursing our goals, rather than having to deal with a roller coaster of emotions which may sabotage and progress we desire.

In order to have effective motivation we need a) reason to pursue our ambition and b) to develop a healthy sense of self-esteem.

When we lose motivation it is because we have lost perspective over our purpose (the logic behind our actions,) so we are going to look at ways with which maintain perspective and create perspective on a daily basis.

Losing perspective also causes us to lose our sense of self-esteem (the way we feel about ourselves) which is vital to maintaining any amount of emotional stability.

The two aspects invariably work in synergy to maintain stability.


### Building self-esteem.


It can be difficult to act once we have lost motivation and have become depressed.

It simply means that we need to take small steps towards rebuilding our self-esteem and regaining the confidence pursue our ambitions.

Self-esteem is created through our actions and so it is also from our actions that we unintentionally sabotage ourselves.

When we spend all our time coping with our depression in unproductive ways (or even being depressed) then we reinforce these activities into our sense of who we are and what we are capable of.

Even if these activities make us feel guilty or shameful, we use them as a basis to create the identity of who are. In process we end up validating our actions through this positive feedback and consequently, we also validate these negative feelings we create of ourselves.

On the other hand if we create a beneficial form of self-esteem that is based in activities that makes us feel productive and proud of ourselves.

When we validate actions that make us feel productive and proud, we no longer need to use fear or self-criticism to motivate us. We do it because we want to and so we can have responsibility over actions and based on the consequences of those actions, rather than in an expectation of what we believe we should be.

In this case our actions make us feel proud and so we pursue these actions based on the positive feeling they provide. The more positive things we do, the more we reinforce this notion into our mind.

Of course, developing this kind of self-esteem is not infallible. We can still end up turning to self-criticism and feeling of guilt and judgment if we end up creating an image of who we are based on this positive self-esteem.

One of the biggest issues that people have is that they become so used to creating these images in their mind using fear and self-criticism that it becomes instinctual to the point of constantly sabotaging ourselves.

Whenever we create expectations for ourselves, they can only become more and more until they become unmanageable and we feel shame for not being productive.

Identity is the cause for self-criticism and judgment and so by adopting a mindset of learning to dissolve identity, we can end up having more influence over our goals and actions.


### Maintaining perspective.


While perspective is easy to discover initially, most people struggle with maintaining it. That is to say that we can lose mental stability as quickly as we discover it.

What makes perspective difficult to maintain is that once we have restored our sense of self-esteem, we can a) not know exactly what to do in response to it and b) feel that perspective is permanent and is not something which we need to maintain.

It can cause us to become both arrogant and naive at the same time, which is why we usually end up losing our sense of motivation.

This is why it is important to become both humble and accepting to maintain perspective of our mental illness.

It helps to think of perspective like the grammar of a language: A large part of learning and remembering has to do with context, rather than simply knowing.

It means becoming familiar with the idea that we will always be vulnerable to mental illness and that we should always be mindful of our actions and the consequences of those actions.

Perspective is something that we learn gradually with time and experience and this website is full of advice and perspective to help you best reorganise the way you think and function with your mental illness.
