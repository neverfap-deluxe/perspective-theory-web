Consistently managing our depression can feel exhausting at the best of times.

We go through the same cycles again and again, week by week, dictated by that same feelings of pointlessness and hopelessness which continue to wear us down with no end in sight.

Even if we do see minor improvements along the way in our journey, on the whole we still suffer from the same feelings of despair that we feel completely helpless to change.

I am writing this article today to tell you that these feelings are to be expected and that it is not the end of the world.

I also go through these same cycles on a regular basis and even though I have a grasp of my depression, it certainly does not mean that I am no less vulnerable or exhausted by the maintenance of my emotions.

There is a fundamental difference however.

My idea of regular depression is an intense episode of depression once a month and as time goes by, it becomes less and less. It used to be every single day.

I now feel good about myself and I am happy with my life. I feel like I have the confidence and optimism to consistently pursue my ambitions without major disruption. I am now able to act like a functioning adult, rather than a victim to my own depressive emotions.

My depression is nowhere near as exhausting as it used to be. It is not something that enters my mind or drags on me, however this is not to say that I do not put in the effort to maintain perspective of my depression.


### Exhaustion in perception.


Part of the reason why we take our emotions and feelings so personally is because of how we perceive the future and present moment.

When we are stuck in a state of depression or anxiety, the present moment becomes almost unbearable. This is because we have perceive the future as having no potential.

Hope is predicated upon what we think we can gain from the future. When we lose hope, we effectively lose our ambition for the future and this makes the present feel like a pointless endeavour

Resultingly 30 minutes of depression can feel like an eternity of suffering.

Part of what gives me power to be able to manage my depression effectively is in my ability to maintain an optimistic mindset and maintain perspective of my depression, especially when I need it most.

This is also why it is important not to take our emotions personally and to realise that we are vulnerable, even if we think we are strong. This is part of the hubris of losing perspective.

There are a combination of things that when I lose hope, let's say if I am experiencing a craving towards an addition or I am having a feeling towards depression:

Firstly, I learn not to take my feelings personally, because I know they will subside and that it is merely my body reacting biologically, without communicating to me logically.

This not only gives us hope for the future, however it also dissociates us from our feelings/thoughts since we think about ourselves from the third person.

I then try to think about my situation logically and in terms of the consequences of my actions. I also try and think optimistically about my situation and the future; anything in my power to restore hope.

It's funny how pessimistic people instantly discount optimism as this sort of gimmick, however our attitude largely dictates the way we are going to feel about any situation.


### Suffering unnecessarily.


Ultimately our depression can become easy to manage. It only becomes difficult if we do not know how to do it effectively.

Learning to play the piano using only one finger is going to be difficult and exhausting.

This does not mean that piano itself is difficult, however we are a lot more effective if we learn to use all our fingers. At the same time, this does not discount the effort, focus and practice required to be successful. It merely means we have all the tools necessary to be effective.

Our depression functions much in the same way.

Managing it still requires constant work, as does every other single aspect of our lives, however by using all the tools available to us, the aspects of our personality that we find difficult, like our depression and our addiction, can seem like simple pieces to the mind.

Once these habits and perspectives become embedded into our unconscious mind, depression itself will have no influence over our mind.

In fact, you will not even know you have depression.

You will become so focused and so absorbed with your own ambition and embraced by life that depression will seem trivial in retrospect.


### Maintaining perspective.


Depression is like a lot cheeky cousin.

If you do not keep watch of it and constantly give it discipline, it will run havok over your life.

Perhaps the biggest reason why my depressive episodes are not nearly as pervasive in my life, is because I take great care to maintain perspective of my depression.

Often what happens with a lot of people suffering from depression, is that once they reach a level of stability or control over their lives, they instantly become cocky with their thoughts and emotions.

This is something which we cannot afford to do. Prevention is always the most effective way towards progress and so we need to always be thinking about the bad logic and faulty beliefs that consistently trip us into depression.

One of the ways in which we lose perspective is when we discount the progress we have made towards addressing our depression, which is a reflection of our pessimistic and jaded attitudes towards life.

When we surround ourselves with negativity in our lives, this negativity becomes the focus of our experience. It becomes the glass eye with which we view the world.

As a result we fail to recognise all the opportunity and potential in life. We unconsciously give our depression fuel for exhaustion, each and every day.

Pessimism holds us ransom. In fact we begin to believe that we have no other choice, that we are ultimately victims to our own hopelessness.

It is not until we snap out of this thinking that we regain any ounce of hope that we once had. Our failure is in inability to maintain perspective in our lives and consequentially, our newfound hope.

Thus the cycle continues.

While understanding our depression largely comes down to addressing the faulty logic and limiting beliefs in our mind, as well as adopting positive attitudes - maintaining all theses aspects in our mind is equally as important.

Maintaining perspective can be the easiest thing some days, but entirely irrational others.

Part of maintain perspective however, is to not take our depression personally when we feel it has become unmanageable. This simply gives into our depression and make us act ineffectively.

Before we can ever hope to change, acceptance is always the first point of call, even if it is only for a split -second. Through self-awareness we can help ourselves snap out of emotional states and focus on the aspects of our depression that are important to us.
