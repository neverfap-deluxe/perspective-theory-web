There is this misconception that mental illness is something which is fixed.

Like a light bulb that simply switches off in our mind, all our pain and worry dissipates into a void where it no longer has significance in lives

We do not know exactly how it will happen, however it is an idea that we like to keep in our minds to give ourselves hope for the future. In real terms, it is a step up from the confusion we experience on a daily a basis.

In our vague idea, we think that maybe through exhaustion or with enough time we will be set free from our circumstances.

While it is possible for us to have moments of clarity where the world feels normal and we can finally breathe, these episodes are usually short-lasted and in our doubt, we return back to our state of anxiety and depression.

The fact of the reality is that mental illness does not function like a switch and unfortunately it is because of this belief that people do not treat their mental illnesses effectively.

Time can be helpful in helping us gather perspective, however time itself is not what makes for effective recovery. It is through perspective and self-awareness that we learn how to become healthy and functioning. These are the things that time hopes to gain.

There is real hope in us all to become happy and stable a majority of the time. However it requires that we change our way of thinking about mental illness through all the misconceptions that we have created surrounding it


### Misunderstanding mental illness.


While it is impossible to reverse or change the events of the past, this does not mean that we powerless to change the way we perceive these events, as well as the feelings and thoughts that we have towards them.

It is in this way that our trauma is a permanent part of who we are.

In saying this, there is this stigma that our mental illnesses seemingly arrive out of nowhere, like we have been tarnished from our normality and suddenly struck ill. While trauma usually has the effect of changing who we are, it is much more constructive to think of mental illness as a capacity that we all carry within us, rather than something out of the ordinary.

Mental illness is irrespective of age or biology. It is a mental capacity which can affect anyone with a brain.

By embracing this understanding, we do not feel so isolated with our experience with mental illness and nor is anyone any more or less special than anyone else because of their trauma and dysfunction.

In fact, it gives us something to work with as millions of people in your own shoes have managed to overcome similar situations and gain perspective in their lives. We can learn from their experiences as a way of better understanding ourselves.

Even the term "Mental Illness" is deceiving and misinforming within itself. It makes out that there is something fundamentally wrong with us, when in fact, it demonstrates that we are functioning perfectly as intended.

Imagine if you caught the flu and yet displayed no symptoms. It would be incredibly odd and most likely dangerous.

Mental illness should be viewed as a condition of the mind, that in no way reflects on how perfectly wonderful and capable we are as human beings. Just because we do not have the knowledge or the skills to overcome our mental illness, does not make us any less weak.

What is actually dangerous is repressing our memories and living unaware of our circumstances and behaviours, as it makes us incredibly vulnerable to other more potentially harmful activities (addiction, self-harm etc.)

In most cases people usually become wiser and stronger from their trauma, but only once they have learnt to master their mental illness through knowledge and perspective.

Knowledge is important for the simple fact that it is a marker of honesty.

Without knowledge we cannot claim to truly understand ourselves, which is obviously fundamental to any amount of control or direction we want to have in our lives. Furthermore, without knowledge we cannot possibly help ourselves.


### Why mental illness is a mastery.


Self-awareness is so potent because it aims to break down our behaviours, thoughts and feelings into words so that we can have power over our function.

Perspective on the other hand helps us bridge the gap in terms of the context and knowledge required to better understand how our mental illnesses function. Though mental illness is not like an off switch, it can be better related to skill or an ability that must be learnt and mastered.

While mental illness may be complex that does not mean it is unmanageable. From the point of view of a skill, there are arguably thousands of things which are more difficult than overcoming mental illness.

It takes a lot of talent to invent a brand new technology or even in becoming an orthopedic surgeon, however mental illness is something which we all have the ability to conquer. In order to do so we must we the right techniques and strategies to help us get there.

Perspective and self-awareness are proven to help people best understand themselves and there really is no other alternative to understanding ourselves and our thoughts.

With the quick fix mindset, we create this expectation in our minds that merely seeing a doctor or a psychiatrist will magically throw all our problems away.

Unfortunately mental illness does not function this way and though we can rely on medication, it is no substitute to having a strong, healthy mind. Like any other skill, our thoughts, feelings and beliefs need to be studied and understood through self-awareness and perspective.

It is in this sense that a doctor or expert can been seen as our teacher or our guide and we can see ourselves as the student to our problems. Ultimately however, you are responsible for your answers and conclusions to matter how much guidance you receive.

Some or better students than others and are better at self-teaching or others require more guidance. There are an abundance of resources and experts to suit both types of people.

It goes without saying that as long as mental illness is a capacity within us all, there is no hiding or deluding ourselves from it. We can build and form identities or egos to try mask the way we truly feel and we can remain unaware, however we obviously must accept and consequences of remaining ignorant to our own thoughts, feelings and behaviours.

By embracing and understanding how we function instead, we allow ourselves the opportunity to change ourselves for the better. The choice is simply up to you.
