Very few of us think in terms of happiness when thinking about the way in which we live our lives.

We get so caught up within our own responsibilities and obligations that we forget about our own emotional well-being, the only thing we can truly grasp within our own lives.

We end up thinking in terms of logic and consequence, like scathing robots with no purpose beyond our daily tasks. We repeat the same cycles each day, living to exist, rather than existing in this beautiful world to experience the wonders life beholds.

When was the last time you seriously thought about what your own happiness meant to you? Is it even something that you think about often? Does life make you feel excited, knowing that you have the potential to be happy?

For whatever reason we choose not to idolise happiness.

Instead we end up idolising things like fame, exaggerated and unobtainable identities, drugs, conformity… things which we believe will make us happy.

We look beyond the simple emotion because we are lead to believe that it is overly complicated. We believe that happiness is a complex and confusing emotion, since it is something which we are unfamiliar with.

Our lives become so jaded that we begin to believe that everything is inherently negative and full of misery; that happiness is this fleeting, circumstantial emotion.

This article hopes to address all these fallacies and misconceptions of what we believe happiness to be and how we can embrace it as something influential in our lives.


### What is happiness?


Happiness is an emotion. It is a feeling that we all have within us and getting there lies within the attitude that we have towards life.

If are very pessimistic and jaded towards our feelings, thoughts and emotions then we end up feeling like victims of circumstance within our own lives.

We often feel cheated and hopeless, because we believe that we have no control over ourselves and our own lives. We believe that life is something that is inflicted upon us, like a sort of perpetual suffering.

We adopt this passivity because it fits our circumstances perfectly. We act ineffectively in line with our expectations and then once we experience the ineffective results of our outcomes, we fulfill our own self-defeating prophesy and call it a day.

In the process we fail to truly identify and critically think about our experiences objectively in a manner that promotes effective change and responsibility. We simply create this false correlation of matching our experience with our emotions.

This is a very passive and destructive way of living our lives. We make everything in our lives, from our emotions to our opportunities, victims of circumstance and it complete skews the true potential of reality.

Of course none of this has anything to do with happiness at all.

We become so out of the loop that we don’t even remember the basic mechanisms for what evokes our emotions and feelings in the first place.

As a result we lead ourselves to believe that happiness is this a complex emotion, when in actual fact, happiness is a very simple response in our minds.


### The fallacy of passivity.


To claim that we are ultimately passive is a logical fallacy.

To give you an analogy, when people talk about temperature, we think in terms of kinetic movement or in terms of heat.

As a result when we describe things in terms of temperature, we talk about the relative heat available.

So when something drops in temperature, we do not say that the object is now "more cold", since cold is not some kind of anti-heat force.  Instead we can claim that our object is now "less hot".

We can think of the pro-activity in our life in the same way.

It is not that we are ultimately passive and diminished by our environment (more cold), it is merely that we are less active in changing our circumstances to the point that it feels passive (less hot).

If we feel it is too difficult or impossible (pessimism), then we claim that our lives are passive. If we feel that we can change our circumstances to any extent (optimism), then we claim to be pro-active.

This is the importance of viewing things from an optimistic point of view, because it allows ourselves a sense of responsibility and mobility to act against our circumstance - which truly is the only form of hope we in our lives.

Being pro-active demonstrates control over our thoughts and emotions, even if it may take time to produce tangible results.

We are therefore only victim to our own attitudes towards life.

Our circumstances do not dictate how we feel, however it is in our limiting beliefs that develop fears and insecurities that promote passivity in our lives.


### Happiness is not jaded.


All this logic simply over complicates and distorts our pursuit for happiness.

In fact we do absolutely everything… but focus on happiness itself.

We have this idea in our mind that happiness cannot simply exist on its own, that it needs to be tortuously provoked or conjured like some sort of inane witchcraft.

When our lives become so confusing and random and full of pain that we cannot quite explain, then inevitably we are going to apply this belief to everything else in our lives, especially our emotions and thoughts.

This is especially understandably if our experience in life has been nothing but a confusing and disastrous mess.

In addition, we also begin to think that happiness is just this simple and meaningless emotion in ourselves, and that the sadness and tragedy is much more sophisticated and truthful.

This is because we experience such an extensive range of sadness in our lives, that naturally we believe it is more complex than something like happiness which we rarely experience.

In reality, very few of us are experiencing the euphoria of living the lottery on a daily basis, so it's hard to grasp that spectrum within happiness, unlike the crushing hopelessness which may happen on a daily basis, which we also feel more deeply than anything else in our lives.


### Happiness is simple.


While we may find happiness difficult to relate to in our own lives, it does not mean that it is non-existent or no more abundant than any of the other emotions that we can exhibit.

We just need to learn to embrace our positive emotions and happiness really can be as simple as a thought.

Think of something that really makes you happy.

Not just happy, but something that makes you overflow with joy. Visualise this event in your mind. It could be a memory from the past or you can actually picture happiness itself as this sort of energy bubbling inside you.

What was it that made you happy and put a smile on your face? If you haven't quite thought of anything yet, really think back to a time where you just couldn't stop laughing or a hilarious moment you once had.

This is just one of the ways with which we can cultivate happiness.

Another way is to focus on this idea of happiness and to embrace it inside us as this untapped energy. Think of happiness as a sort of meditation in our lives.

Of course there are many more techniques out there, however it is the idea that we all have the potential for long lasting happiness, but that it is also something we need to work on and cultivate in our lives.

Make it a priority in your life to embrace the feeling of happiness inside you, because it is certainly something which we can forget and lose perspective of.
