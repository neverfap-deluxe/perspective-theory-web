Mental illness is not complicated.

Like mental efficiency, mental illness is a basic capacity within us all that can just as readily be rejected as it can be employed.

Since mental illness is a capacity, I do not believe that there anything extraordinary or unique about being mentally ill.

<!-- more -->

I simply believe that mental illnesses is the result of a gross error of procedure, either through trauma or general ignorance. In most cases, a combination of both.

I would compare the quality of mental illness to losing an arm car crash or becoming a memory grand master. It is the simple result of a process with obvious consequences.

Unfortunately the confusion and mania of mental illness can make it incredibly difficult to see the clarity of our actions, especially when we do not have the perspective or self-awareness to even recognise and understand them.

This creates the impression in our mind that our mental illness is a byproduct of our own inability to function; that it is to say it simply because of who we are.

One of the issues with our mental illness is that it can develop over many years and only form once all conflicting factors are in place. In fact, as a capacity, we can just as easily go back to being mentally ill once having overcome our depression, irregardless of how self-aware we are or perspective we have.

As a result our mental illness can have the effect of making us feel broken and hopeless as individuals. It can make us feel as if there is something inherently wrong with us like a curse has been placed upon our soul.

While some people have more of a capacity for mental illness than others, this is not a reflection of what we are capable for function as people, only dysfunction.

It is important to understand that this capacity that can be diminished, just as it can be elevated. In addition, having the capacity to be excessively emotional does not mean that we must alternate between extreme happiness and sadness all the time.

Learning to understand how our capacity for mental illness functions can help us better gain perspective an acquaint ourselves with ideas that help our recovery, rather than hinder it.


### How mental illness changes our mindset.


Mental illness can be difficult to recover from because it plays with our perception of not only who we are, but what we believe we are capable of. We become cynical and we adopt pessimistic outlooks on life. We become shortsighted and irrational. We almost seem to do the exact opposite to what will help us.

In other words, our mental illness causes us to view other mental illness as an inherent incapacity of dysfunction, rather than a capacity for change.

This is why perspective (particularly optimistic perspectives) are so important for us to better develop function in our lives and expose our misconceptions of what mental illness is.

Those most effective with their recovery are those who are willing to trial through new and different ideas so that they can eventually discover perspective that is constructive to their lives.

Part of the reason why people remain depressed for decades is because they cling onto old others, while others only remain depressed for a few years or even a few months at most.

People who effectively recover from depression are those who think critically about their own emotions and feelings and constantly seek perspective.

This not only means being open to new ideas, but understanding when to move on from ideas and perspectives that are not working out. This is because we are unlikely to find the right perspective right away, just like anything else in life.

This is why it is important to assume that everything we know about mental illness is wrong while we are depressed, because naturally we are finding ways and points of view to sabotage our progress.

It is important to understand that hen we are recovering from mental illness, we are always starting from a new plate, no matter how much we think we know about ourselves. The issue with a lot of cynics is that they become so fearful and jaded that do not allow themselves ever to move on and as a result, they remain unaware of their own behaviours and habits no matter how low or how badly they harm themselves.

Rather, they live in so much fear and that they allow the delusion to consume them and dictate their own lives.

An important part of our recovery is slowly regaining trust within ourselves and demonstrating what we are truly capable of beyond the stories and narratives that we tell ourselves on a daily basis.

We do this not only by demonstrating what we are capable of through action, however also by dissolving and dismantling the false assumptions and narratives that we keep in our mind.


### Why there is hope for our mental illness.


It helps to think of our mental health as a combination of our capacity to be mentally ill and our capacity to be mentally stable.

Some aspects of our personality will be more neurotic than others, however that does not mean that we do not have a grasp on other areas of our life.

While we cannot change our capacity for mental illness, that does not mean we must function within this capacity and certainly it does not mean we must suffer uncontrollably.

Emotional and logical harmony is something we are not used to, and must slowly become familiar with.

In a sense, discovering perspective is like a lucky draw. While the correct perspectives exist out there, it is likely we will discover harmful perspectives based upon our misconceptions, sooner than we will find helpful ones.

This is why it fundamental that we learn to think critically about perspective and the kind of information we consume, otherwise we risk leaving our recovery to blind luck. Another reason why people remain mentally ill is because they are afraid of making the sacrifices necessary to overcome their mental illness.

Of course, what appears to be a sacrifice to one person is indeed an opportunity for another. If we stay within our cynicism, then overcoming our mental illness will never appear to be an opportunity, as much as it will seem a sacrifice.

Instead of focusing on the potential of being happy, we worry about how we may become vulnerable or that our efforts might not pay off.

Certainly it took me quite a few years before I could properly change my mindset and as difficult as it has been, I am happy I took the leap.
