Perspective does not have to be complex.

While the realm of perspective can be incredibly vast and confusing, our approach towards our problems should be gradual effort that is largely focused on specific outcomes.

The reason why perspective can seem overwhelming at times is because of the way we over-complicate our problems, and thus over-complicate our solutions.

In the confusion and mania of our depression we can lose judgment of how best to approach our mental issues and so we seize up and lose control. We breed uncertainty from our confusion and we panic.

In addition we can spend so much time reading about self-awareness and perspective that when a depressive or panic episode strikes, we can not only feel confused, however assume guilt and shame for not having the answers to our problems - despite how much we feel we have learnt about ourselves.

These feelings are not only common, however they are to be expected and struggle is a concept that needs to be embraced in our lives.


### Perspective is a skill, rather than a theory.


Perhaps the biggest misconception of mental illness is that perspective and self-awareness can serve as a sort of immediate logical fix to our problems.

We may assume that our psychological problems inherently require mental solutions as a result and that merely reading about how our minds work can alleviate us from our dysfunction.

In actual fact our mental illness has less to do with our thoughts and feelings, and more to do with the cognitive processes that take place in our mind which reside in our behaviours and beliefs as a person.

This is to say that perspective and self-awareness is a practice rather than a theory. It is a skill that we develop which takes time through consistent and gradual effort.

Maintaining our mental health functions in the same way we learn any other skill. We need to practice and learn and develop the kinds of skills and abilities that give us control over our mental illness.

If we want to become fluent with speaking French we cannot hope to simply be able to speak it overnight. We need to practice (mindfulness, self-awareness) not to mention all the grammar and vocabulary (perspective, theory).

Understanding that mental illness not only requires a lot of knowledge of how it functions, but also requires knowledge of context, is vital. This is why the process of understanding perspective needs to be gradual, much in the same way that learning any skill needs to be done step-by-step and with patience.

An important part of this is to learn to dissolve our expectations of who we believe we grow into, and simply live in the moment with who we are. Perspective is always about the small things that we can do and apply to our lives, rather than serving as the gigantic band-aid that we all hope for.

Naturally we are going to struggle when we speak to someone for the first time in a different and unfamiliar language, which is why perseverance and focus can help us go a long way in our struggle.

Certainly overcoming our mental illness through perspective and self-awareness is not easy, as it is a process of better coming to understand ourselves from a point of view of clarity and comprehension - something which we have yet to develop.


### How we overcomplicate our problems.


Perhaps we think that these are things that we simply cannot learn or our mental illness prevents us from ever understanding. It can help to understand that most barriers are self-created and self-imposed by ourselves. Truth shows that we are our worst culprit in preventing ourselves from self-discovery, much more than anyone else in our lives.

However, the only reason why we create these barriers is because we fail to break down and simplify our problems so that they can be targeted and focused upon.

One of these ideas that we have is that self-awareness and perspective must be some kind of inaccessible grand mastery; that unless if we have understand every single thing about ourselves that we are utterly useless and vulnerable to our mental illness.

It is almost like suggesting that we cannot use the English language unless if we know every single word and it is this type of thinking typifies the very kind of perfectionist, self-defeating mindsets that people with mental illness can have.

Over-complicating our problems immediately over-complicates our solutions as well, which is why we need to start take things step-by-step and not become so worried with our expectations of recovery and simply find the courage to expose ourselves and try new things.

In other words we can over-complicate our problems in life due to the very way in which we define them.

If we believe that our mental illness is this kind of great challenge that cannot be overcome then that is literally how we will view our solutions - as some kind of miracle that can only hope to stumble upon one day, assuming it even exists.

If we believe that we cannot be helped, then we will not allow ourselves to be helped not matter how hard we try.

In a lot of cases we can do things that are beneficial to us (like eat healthy or practice meditation) but ultimately if we do not believe these measures are truly effective, then we can very rarely hope to maintain these behaviours.

Maintaining these behaviours is fundamental in changing our neural pathways so that we can consistently adopt empowering mindsets which give us hope and power.


### Changing the way we think about our illness.


Self-awareness is always the first step to self-discover and so identifying our logic and behaviours can go a long way to better understanding ourselves.

Start by identifying your emotions and beliefs. How do your thoughts make you feel? What kind of logic dictates the way you feel? Think of it from the point of view of an intimate journal. In particular, try and focus on how we set up expectation for ourselves in terms of the anxiety and depression we feel. Is the guilt we feel conditional or for any particularly reason?

It can be helpful to base our recovery in some form of constant ambition or effective self-esteem, as a way of basing our attitudes and feelings on what we should do, rather than on this ideal of who we should become.

The moment we dissolve our feelings and expectations of who we should be is when we can finally live without insecurity and fear.

Of course, these are all ideas that will come naturally later. Perspective needs to start small and gradually build up. We need to understand the basic concepts and utilise them in our lives, before trying anything else.

Awareness is a process, not a simple matter of exposure therapy and without starting small we cannot hope to go anywhere.
