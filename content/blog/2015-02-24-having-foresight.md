Many of us lack foresight in our decisions.

This is usually because we lack the knowledge and context required to truly manage our thoughts and feelings. We fail to understand ourselves and who we are as people.

Instead we allow our emotions to carry us away and dictate our attitudes. We intend our thoughts to cause havoc in our minds and it is like we live this inherent disarray in our lives.

Even if we have good intentions of who we want to become, when we lack foresight into the process  it is comparable to driving an unknown vehicle on a standard road.

It could be a monster truck, it could be a limousine, it could be just a normal car; however without truly knowing our vehicle, we cannot hope to comprehend how we will do on the road.

Instead we rely on our intuition and we generalise our circumstance, which leads to misunderstanding who we are and causing harm to ourselves along the way.


### Understanding the future by focusing on the present.


Part of learning to plan ahead is about understanding where we stand today and how we relate to our emotions and feelings.

While our emotions can make us feel like we are not in control, it helps to merely think of them as blinker lights trying to tell us a message, as opposed to a definite version of reality.

In fact, part of the reason we have these reactions in the first place is because we lack foresight into the process of managing them. You see, foresight is very much about the present, rather than what lies ahead.

What foresight really relates to is understanding who you are today, so that you can control who you are in the future.

I know personally that whenever I have panic attacks, that it is not something which seemingly comes out of the blue. In actual fact, we slowly build up and set ourselves up for these panic attacks without realising it.

It is only because panic attacks overcome us so suddenly that they feel like they come out of the blue. Our emotions have fooled us again.

One popular example is when we are trawl through our favourite internet websites. We start with Facebook, then Tumblr, then our favourite news websites, and then we run out of things to do and we keeping cycling through them.

We become restless and we start messaging our usual friends, however they do not seem to be there. We become desperate for attention and we frantically search for what cannot be provided. It soon snowballs into an episode of OCD and you fall into a state of panic.

By planning ahead and catching ourselves from these behaviours, we can effectively prevent these responses from occurring in the first place.


### Thinking about the process.


One thing that is vital for people to have control over themselves and have foresight, is for us to plan (and more importantly understand) how we are going to achieve our goals and function on a daily basis.

If we begin to think about the process, we can essentially break down everything into manageable tasks. However to truly understand what gives these tasks strength, is to understand how we give them meaning.

What I’m referring to is the vision that we have of ourselves and our future. Our vision is where we live, while our goals are simply the end to our means.

We will have many goals in our life and many of them will never turn out the way we want to, but our vision essentially allows us to afford as many goals as we want to pursue.

Understanding this process of control not only gives us hope, however it demonstrates that life is ultimately manageable and through self-awareness, we can learn many tools to keep ourselves in check. Each one relates to a different aspect of our psyche.

We often set ourselves up for disappointment, not because of the size of our goals and ambitions, but because we misunderstand the process and who we are. Without certainty and process, we do not have confidence in ourselves to act.

Worst of all is when people doubt their own certainty and so they never give themselves the chance to ever develop or consider confidence.

We can all be confident in our actions, but only once we understand them and what is required understand who you are.
