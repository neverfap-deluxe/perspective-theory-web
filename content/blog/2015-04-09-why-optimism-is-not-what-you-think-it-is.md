I once was adamant that optimism was bullshit.

I was 100% convinced that optimism was a state of delusion which masked people’s guilt and shame behind their own failures in life. I could not have thought of anything more dishonest or dangerous.

In retrospect of these thoughts, I now know it was because I actually knew very little about optimism, let alone my own deeply pessimistic mindset. All my ideas where based in misconception, rather than fact.

This is why self-awareness and perspective is so useful, because it can help us put our thoughts, feelings and emotions into words so that we can have a better understanding of what things are and how they work, rather than rely on our own biased instinct which we are trying to change.

One of the biggest problems that people stuck in pessimism (or even excessive optimism) have is that they cannot think of the world objectively outside of their own way of thinking. If you are cynical then naturally everything will be a reflection of that, even inherently optimistic ideas.

What strikes me the most however is that these were my thoughts less than one year ago. It demonstrates how quickly people can change and become aware of their circumstances.

So what is the deal? Is constant optimism the only alternative to pessimism?

Well, I was partially correct with my feelings.

While optimism can be bad, I was so jaded within my own pessimism that I could not see the possible harm in my own point of view. In fact, I did not even know what optimism or pessimism was terms of my own life, nor that it was something I had control over. I simply thought that life has miserable: End of story.


### Addressing our misconceptions of optimism.


The key is knowing when to be optimism or pessimism.

Now that I have more knowledge on the matter, I have come to realise that both these states of mind have the potential to become useful and helpful. Firstly however, we need to understand the role of attitude and what we can use it for. The reason we have attitude is to drive us towards our goals.

If we have a positive attitude, then that will help us overcome our goals much easier than if we were to have a pessimistic or uncertain attitude.

Perhaps the greatest misconception I held about optimism (and largely my own pessimism) was that our attitude was an inherent part of who we are, rather than something we could direct or have power over.

I never knew that attitudes like optimism or pessimism were learnt behaviours that could be provoked through our actions and behaviours. They are not permanent traits.

This is why we need to assume that everything we know about our mental illness could be potentially wrong. When we become so stuck within our own point of view, we do not even realise that we are being pessimistic or dysfunctional.

What we want to promote is a critical thought and critical points of view so we can dissect our thoughts, beliefs and feelings, rather than view them as something natural. Without questioning ourselves, we cannot hope to change ourselves.

As an extension of this understanding it is also important that we view optimism and pessimism in terms of being skills, rather than permanent personality traits.

It was not until later into my process of studying self-awareness, that I came to understand optimism as a way of helping us overcome our challenges in life, rather than a lightbulb we need to keep switched on 24/7.

On the contrary, pessimism is more useful in terms of analysing and questioning information, particularly as far as self-awareness and perspective is concerned.


### Stuck in a rigid point of view.


We simply do not have the capacity to think clearly when we are in any state of delusion.

What makes it so difficult is that we do not have the ability within ourselves to empathise with our own behaviours, simply because we are not self-aware enough to even recognise them as something harmful, let alone acknowledge them at all.

We find it incredibly difficult to empathise with something we are not, which is why empathy and acceptance are skills that need to be taught and understood in order to be employed.

For example when we feel incredibly sad for a long time, happiness can seem like a distant memory. When we fall into anxiety, it seems as if our comfort and confidence has never existed at all.

In order to move away from our attitudes and limiting beliefs, we need to learn to empathise and accept who we are. Through critical thinking we can dissect these aspects of our psyche and restore stability and function.

It is easy for our cynicism to take over and assume control over our lives, however this in no way denotes reflects on optimism or pessimism as tools to help you within our life. It reflects primarily on our own ability to function. Our attitude in life is the one of the defining factors which sets us all apart, so it makes sense to use it properly for our own success, goals and ambition.

No one is truly a creature of circumstance, only in the narrative that we tell ourselves on a daily basis through self-doubt and misconception.

Using tools like self-awareness and perspective, we can learn to dismantle these narratives and truly see ourselves from a more honest and approachable angle.
