Many of us romanticise our depression.

You know what I’m talking about: the desire for tragic romance, the kind of emotional music we listen to, the way in which we fantasise about depression and even in the way we dress and express ourselves.

In it's more extreme forms, some of us go as far as to idolise self-harm culture and surround ourselves by suicide memes and personalities.

We romanticise depression because it makes us feel special and less isolated from our own feelings. We become a part of these cultures because they relate to the way we feel about ourselves. We feel like we are joining something which we can relate to and which also makes sense.

It’s interesting how my attitudes towards depression have change over the years. I used to be specifically attracted to women with mental illness, the more messed up the better.

While I still love listening to same terrible music that relates to depression and tragedy, I no longer find depression or mental illness attractive. I acknowledge that it is harmful to romanticise depression and promote depression as something sexy or even appealing in our lives.

Though in the moment it becomes self-reinforcing. The more we relate to depression, the more we want to be depressed and embrace it within ourselves. This makes us feel like we have some sort of self-worth amongst the sadness.


## Why we romanticise depression.


We usually embrace depression in response to failing to find romance in empowerment and happiness. Instead, we feel compelled to find beauty in our victimisation and the sadness which we have embraced.

Some of us remain depressed for so long that our depression becomes the only thing we can relate to and so naturally it is also where we try and find romance. We do it to seek like-minded people who share our same experiences and points of view. This becomes our common ground for love and friendship.

In a sense it is a coping mechanism to deal with our reality. It is how we find support and even encouragement for our basic existence.

One of the significant issues when we do this for support, rather than seeking experts who understand depression and how to help us change who we are, is that things can become messy once we attach to people who are depressed.

This can cause us to remain depressed, simply to maintain the friendship and connection.

Much like how in the same way that drugs are a common point for people to come together, to remove the depression is also the remove the reason and relationship with another person.

This was what hurt me most about first relationship with someone who was mentally ill. On the one hand I knew it was in my best interest not leave the relationship, as it was heavy affecting my own mental health, but obviously the attachment and connection was difficult to break.

In the aftermath you feel a lot of guilt, shame and even regret about the decisions you have made to do something about your depression, which is an integral part of recovering from our depression.

As we mature and eventually learn to effectively manage the depressive side of our personality, our tastes in romance and beauty also change. We no longer feel so inclined to relate to our world through depression and so we become and develop into different people.

Our depression and mental illness seem almost childish in retrospect because of their irrationality and ineffectiveness.

When once we found tragedy appealing, we now find juvenile and foolish. Neuroticism seems unbearable and the magic of depression no longer becomes appealing.


## Why we shouldn’t romanticise depression.


Ultimately depression is not a healthy common ground for us to have, simply because it is a destructive aspect of our personality that romanticisation can easily lend to further destruction and depression.

There is no logical reason why we should promote and embrace destructive behaviours, much in the same way that society does not promote smoking or excessive alcoholism.

While these kinds of destructive behaviours can be used to inspire us and even assist in producing interesting lives full of danger and consequence, the majority of us who merely aim to be productive and functional cannot afford these sorts of privileges.

Depressive culture is not an entirely bad thing. It gives us a common point with likeminded people to share ideas and discuss the issues with have. It is not perfect, however in a lot of cases it is a lot better than nothing.

Ultimately it is about understanding the responsibility that we owe to ourselves over our mental health, irregardless of the attachments and friendships we make. This is something which only you can decide.

Once depressive cultures form into unhealthy obsessions, where we begin to care more about the depression and the culture more than our own mental health then we can end up forming another layer of destructive behaviour to our lives.

The takeaway is that when you attach to someone who is depressed, either in friendship or love, you begin to idealise depression as something beautiful. We do this by relating our attachment back to the positive experience we are having, which legitimises our depressive thoughts and feelings.

Many of us do this subconsciously in our minds, which is why it is important to become aware of our behaviours and the context with which they arrive.

One of the particularly major issues that some people have, myself especially, is that we tend to idealise just about everything our minds can get a hold of, from the good to the bad.

My understanding is that this relates to the male pursuit for complete and undying freedom, while the feminine has more desire for undying love. I enjoy looking at all the possibilities in life and the freedom of action and so everything becomes an ideal in my mind. It is part of what drives my ambition as a person.

If we try and dissolve these identities and particularly maintain perspective so that these identities don’t get out of hand, then we can have focus in our lives, so that we do not get carried away from things like depression and even excessive optimism which can also be harmful.


## Dissolving our romanticism.


Most prominently we can address the false assumptions leading to our conclusions about depression, as our ideals are generally over exaggerated, generalised and distorted to the point of not being untrue.

What this means, is that to maintain a level of self-awareness in our lives so that we are living in the present and not in the fantasy world of our minds.

By understanding how we romanticise things in our mind, we can prevent and change our behaviours and the way we think, in a way that we are not bound by fear or limitation, but embraced by the unlimited possibility and potential for every aspect of life.

In addition to this step we need to train our focus so that we can direct our ambition into productive pursuits, rather than on maintaining our depression.

These are all things that will take time and empathy is an invaluable skill to get there. It is nice for all of us to daydream at times, and sometimes it simply happens subconsciously.

However once the images and identities form into obsessive and solid beliefs in our minds, we can end up deluding ourselves into idealising things like depression in our lives.
