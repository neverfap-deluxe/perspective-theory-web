I often refer to the idea of an effective human being.

When we are effective, we are in control of who we are, our emotions and our thoughts. To be effective is to be functioning to the best of our abilities in a way which we can develop ourselves without fear or resistance, with purpose and focus in mind.

Ultimately, we do not have to be effective human beings. There is no moral consequence, though through our logic we can beget shame or guilt within ourselves for not being effective.

It is simply a way for us to exist which can allow us to achieve our goals and ambitions with a methodological process in mind.

I do not believe that effectiveness is difficult. I believe it is a process, like anything else. I certainly do not talk about effectiveness from an idealistic point of view. I do not in a perfect way to exist, only which subsist with our individual values as people.

I personally promote effectiveness for ambitious individuals, who wish to achieve their goals and dreams with ease, without any of the negative ramifications that self-criticism and judgmental attitudes can provide.


### **The fear of change.**


Of course, in order to be effective, we must change who we are and how we think, and this scares a lot of people. In fact, fear of change is the primary reason why people remain ineffective, from their goals to their actions.

We fear change because we attach ourselves to our identities and egos. We believe that these images are who we are, and once we convince ourselves for long enough that these identities are the status quo then it can be very difficult to attempt anything new.

People generally fear more about who they are losing, rather than who they are going to become. This is because of our pessimistic attitude.

On the other hand, if you view change as an opportunity of becoming someone new, rather than losing who you are, then there is nothing to fear.

What cements this fear in place is this idea that our identities and egos are these concrete structures. That if we change them, they are gone forever. However, this is hardly true.

Once you adopt self-awareness and learn who you are and how you function as a person, then you will discover that you can simply become whoever you want to be. Furthermore, you learn that you are not limited to characters and identities due to fear and insecurity – it then becomes a matter of choice.

The reason why actors are so good at what they do is because they are entirely self-aware of who they are and who they are trying to play. This level of understanding does not diminish the feeling of being the character either – in many ways it enhances it.

Once we do become effective and master our understandings of who we are, then it actually gives us more choice to express ourselves. We learn that to play characters out of fear and insecurity is inherently childish.


### **Dissolving our identity.**


Perhaps the hardest part in understanding who we are, is in dissolving our identity of who we think we are.

This is the hard part for most people, as we are naturally attached to our identity.

There are obviously many ways you can do this, however observation is one I will talk about in this article, as it is the most simple, though I’ll talk about other techniques in later articles.

By simply observing our behaviours and actions, we can catch ourselves from doing.

Half the reason why we repeat many of the harmful behaviours we make on a daily basis is that we do not think about even doing them. They have been firmly cemented into our consciousness and form habits over time that we are not even aware of.

Consider this: It is estimated that we blink more than 28,000 times a day.

Now of the hundreds of millions of times that you have blinked in your entire life, how many of those times have you payed attention to it or acknowledged it in your mind?

Arguably, very few times.


### **Paying attention to our identity.**


What helps is imagining that we’ve stepped out of our bodies, as if we are observing ourselves a few metres from where we are.

We need to constantly think about our actions and the consequences that they bring to our lives. Certainly it is not something to worry about, but it is something to take responsibility of.

All these skills take time to develop, but once they become a standard in our lives we no longer need to live as if it is all a vague blur. We can take control of our actions and become more effective human beings.

While it’s difficult to dissolve our identity entirely and certainly I slip up, I feel I am largely in-control of my life. I am not afraid to make a fool of myself in public, because I acknowledge my identity is faulty and that it does not truly protect me.

It merely serves as a hindrance to who I want to become.

Certainly my humour and wit is still wildly messed up and inappropriate. I still love all the things that I used to before. I still listen to the same terrible, screamo music. I still think the world is largely surreal.

However rather than being limited by my identity, I now feel somewhat… free to move around in my mind.
