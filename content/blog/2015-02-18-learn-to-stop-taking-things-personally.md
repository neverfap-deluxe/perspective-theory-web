It is easy to be offended by people and concepts that don't quite fit our notions of reality.

We may perceive the actions or thoughts of another person (and even of ourselves) as being rude or hurtful. It could be that it goes against your moral code or the way you feel about yourself or a number of different things.

What people don’t realise is that not only does it take a lot of energy to take something personally, but that it takes even more faith to uphold a moral standard which is vulnerable to offense.

While anger and frustration may be useful at achieving particular outcomes in our lives, like scaring away someone we do not like, it is emotionally destructive and harmful when we used on our family, friends and loved ones.

When we exaggerate our emotions it is a blatant form of emotional manipulation. Worst of all is that we become self-critical of ourselves, and so not only do we end up manipulating ourselves and becoming neurotic, but we also end up distancing ourselves and from others.

It is not an open, honest way of expressing our intentions and who we are.


### The structure of agreements.


When we take things personally we essentially give in and agree to what is being said or claimed. We are only offended because we choose to give power to their words or actions. The result is emotionally reactive and distressed, perhaps even leading to anger and confrontation.

To demonstrate the silliness of this all, if you someone comes up to you and mocks you, claiming that your pink hair looks silly, you will not take much from it, other than this person is odd.

They could even say it in the most horrible way – at the end of the day, it is only what you are willing to believe.

Likewise if someone ever comments on your weight and you become offended, it is not because of your weight, but because of the assumptions that you personally have of your weight.

If you think your weight is something that is inherently negative, then the other person (and even more likely, yourself) will trigger this belief in your mind.

At the end of the day you are what you believe and assumptions you are making behind these beliefs. In a lot of cases the way we respond and react is emotionally destructive, rather than constructive.


### Why we take things personally.


We take these things personally because we believe that our image or identity of ourselves has been attacked. Our identity itself is just a belief that we have of who we should be or maintain in our mind.

Our image is not inherently real, however living with it and all the associated emotions attached to our identity gives it life and meaning. We sacrifice ourselves and our emotions to this identity and it begins to control us and who we are.

Of course, it’s not just offense that we can take personally. We can also take compliments personally as well. When our loved ones tell us how much they mean to us, it will usually evoke a sense of love and self-worth.

On the flipside, hearing a negative thing from someone close to us can affect us deeply and this is the doubled edged sword of taking statements personally, especially if we have emotionally abusive and manipulative friends and loved ones in our lives.

This is a very simple and linear way of interpreting the world. It is self-defeating and self-reinforcing. We no longer become driven by our own ability to critically think and this gives other people power to change how we feel, rather than within our own power.

We give up responsibility over our own emotions which only hopes to exploit our vulnerability, rather than empower it.


### Embracing the present.


More crucially, perhaps it is more important to note that nothing in life is truly personal, only if we allow it to be.

In essence we must decide whether taking things personally is truly beneficial for ourselves and others. I believe that there are more effective ways to influence others, particularly when it comes to our own children, friends and loved ones.

Not only will they eventually figure out the ways in which we play against their emotions (particularly children), resulting in spite and hatred, however it is something that will end up distancing yourself from others and particularly yourself.

One thing that can go a very long way is remaining neutral. A large majority of the reactions that we may have on a daily basis are unnecessary and merely serve to promote hatred and negativity.

Depression itself takes nothing personally. So why should it deserve the same treatment?

We need to learn to give and receive our emotions independent of the world around us.
