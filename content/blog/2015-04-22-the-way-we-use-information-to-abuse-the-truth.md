Perhaps technology has progressed further than our ability to process it.

Never in the history of our species have we ever had so much knowledge available to our whim, especially since the rise of the internet and digital communications.

We can learn just about anything we want, at any time, anywhere. No longer are the world’s experts an invisible veil and through this collaboration, the human race is discovering more and more about this world at a frightening pace.

As a result many popular misconceptions from the past have been addressed and particularly, we now know a lot more about mental illness and how it functions. Not only from scientific points of view, but also from an anecdotal.

Yet in-spite of this universal access to information, an opportunity we have all embraced in our lives through the news and media we consume, cases of mental illness are on the rise.

On the whole never have humans become more stressed, more medicated or more self-conscious about who they are than we do currently and the trend only seems to be getting worse. What is perplexing is that all the information is already out there to help us overcome our mental illness.

Thousands upon thousands of websites exist on the internet with a variety of answers to all our problems and there is no shortage of experts and opinions to give us the answers we desire.

Therein lies the problem.

With such a variety of answers and information, we tend to chase points of view that validate our beliefs, rather than seek the opinions that we truly need to hear to change our lives.

Instead of using this abundance of information to help us discover truth and liberate ourselves from misconception, we have instead used this opportunity to further distract ourselves and feed into the misery of our depression.


### Why the abundance is a privilege.


Firstly, it largely comes down to the way we view privilege and abundances in our lives. There is this fatal narrative in society that technology and science will save us.

Technology is advancing a rate never seen before and with all the new gadgets and gizmos in our lives, it can appear as if we are also developing new and more complex answers to all of life’s gaping problems.

We take the belief that life should become fundamentally simpler because of this technology, which in other words is to say that we can use this opportunity to simply ignore responsibility and live without consequence.

In actual fact technology changes none of the basic requirements we have as humans. All technology has done is change our perception towards how we should live our lives.

We still need to eat. We still need to feel loved. While technology can help us achieve these goals, it is not a direct substitute for these things. Technology can only assist us, much in the same way that it can sabotage us.

More often than not, we use the internet and our technology to distract us from what is truly important in our lives, rather than  help empower us to reach those goals.

Another issue is that technology is relative, rather than absolute. If everyone is having the same advantage with technology, then it does not truly make things like competition (i.e. dating) any easier, since everything has the same privilege.

The problem is that once we start viewing technology as a privilege, we invariably take abuse our lives and our circumstance.

Technology and information can only be as useful as the person relying on it, so instead of thinking in terms of what technology is capable of, we need to think about how technology can assist us specifically in the various areas of our lives.

If we are using the internet to feed into our gaming or pornography addictions, then is this a proper and efficient use of technology?

We quickly turn information into a burden rather than a tool of empowerment and purpose.

While there is nothing wrong with using information for trivial and fun pursuits, it is something that we need to become mindful of in our lives, especially if we are using technology to mask our pain and suffering by promoting ignorance.


### Why we embrace ignorance.


It is funny how we talk about technology and science as a tool for empowerment, when in actual fact it can be absolutely anything you want it to be.

Technology can equally be a tool for enslavement and this is a quality we all instantly overlook.

Instead, we look at the branding and advertisement of the technology by only buying into the potential benefits, rather than through the spectrum of our own personality.

If I have a highly addictive personality is it really in my best interest to play an online video game that is known to be highly addictive? In a way the true potential of technology masks itself through perception. Our mind thinks in terms of possibility, yet completely overlooks the reality of the situation.

When you think of all the information out there on the internet, there is several billion lifetimes worth of information out there that we can never hope ever to consume.

Instead, we need to ask ourselves how much of this information is truly relevant to our aspirations and life goals.

How much of this information assists us in becoming the ideal version of ourselves in 10 years time? How much of this information contributes towards our own happiness and emotional stability?

As much as we believe that we can live in an alternate universe where ignoring responsibility is viable, mental illness will always be the result of a cognitive dissonance in our minds.

Ignorance this dissonance has no positive effect of taking away our pain and suffering. It can only hope to cause more confusion and pain in our lives, no matter how great of an illusion we create for ourselves.


### Learning to accept the truth.


In a sense we do not have the same privilege of those who were born in the past.

Humans once lived in an innocence of misconception, ranging from the supposedly health benefits of smoking all the way to the deep superstitions from the past.

The truth can be difficult to handle, especially if we have lived with a certain mindset our entire lives. However a large part of addressing our mental illness is to also address the responsibility that we owe to ourselves to change the way we think.

If we neglect and abuse our responsibility, then we have no one else to blame but ourselves. We can try our hardest to blame others, however ultimately it is only you who must deal with the consequences of your own ignorance. There is no harm in the truth, only in our refusal to accept it. As the quote goes, "Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored."

The truth should be viewed as something noble and this means accepting the responsibility and duty that we have to ourselves to overcome our mental illness, if that is our very purpose.

While we can use technology to delude ourselves and create more confusion, it also a perfect opportunity for liberation. Without accepting the consequences of our actions there can be no justice in our lives.
