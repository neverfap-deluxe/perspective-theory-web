Many of us suffer from some form of insecurity.

We may worry about how others perceive who we are. It may be the belief that we are incapable of achieving our goals because of a past failure or event - all of which affect our own sense of self-worth.

Insecurity embodies a mindset predicated upon fear and doubt. It offers no opportunity to look beyond who we really are and who we want to become. It is a way of stifling confidence with fear.

It is very important to note that these feelings of insecurity are just that - feelings predicated by how we perceive ourselves. It is in no way indicative of who we actually are as people, only what we choose to see.

Certainly insecurity can be dismantled, just as easily as it was constructed. It requires an understanding of what insecurity is and how to address the false underlying assumptions which bring them to life.


### **The construction of insecurity.**


It’s funny how willingly we give our own past labels. We group things in terms of successes or failures (we will use these terms loosely, as a way of describing the moral concepts of good and bad), however this relates more prominently to how our past events make us feel, either good or bad.

Anything that made us feel amazing is seen as a success and yet all those horrible moments we hope to forget ever happened, are seen as glaring failures.

Part of the reason why we are insecure is because we still see these events from the past in terms of being successes and failures, rather than simple history with no affiliation with how they made us feeling.

Of course, there are some failures in our lives that we actually cherish. There is no attachment of shame to these events and we do not see these past events as beings failures, because we managed to use the opportunity to learn from it. We addressed the failure in our minds, so-to-speak.

Essentially we associate ourselves as failures to the events in our lives that made as feel bad.

**How we have learnt to live with insecurity.  **

Instead of addressing our insecurities and simply accepting that failure and success are merely labels to describe how we feel, rather than who we are, many of us have simply learned to live or cope with our fears and insecurities.

In fact, we try to use them to our advantage, growing this insecurity inside us until we are no longer able to distinguish that it was something we developed out of our feelings in the first place.

This is part of the reason why people find it difficult to change who they are, because they fear losing a part of themselves. They forget that they even changed in the first place.

Some of us live with our insecurities for such a long time that we actually begin to believe that it is how we are meant to  function - driven by fear, rather than by inspiration. We allow these insecurities eat away inside us, to develop into awful habits to fuel this awful dream in our mind.

There are numerous examples with your peers and yourself. We develop eating disorders on the assumption that we should be a particular body image. We live in sadness and depression because we do not have the so-called 'ideal partner', which drives us to date a countless number of horrible people and be taken advantage of.


### When we use identity to protect us**.**


All the while, we feel entirely worthless about who we are… unless we pursue this identity of who we should be in our mind.

We feel that if we pursue this identity, then it can address our perceived inadequacies as people. We think we should be thinner, smarter, better - in other words that we should be perfect, rather than feel good about ourselves for who we are.

When we have insecurities, we effectively have an idea of who we should be in our minds. Naturally, it is impossible to become this idea, because the insecurity is already an exaggeration of what it means to be human.

We project these identities as ideas and images through our imagination. Picture how they portray clubs in the movies. They make it out to be glamourous, with champagne flowing everywhere and hot people dancing at your whim. Our imagination essentially does the same with our identity.


### **When our identity takes over.  **


These images and beliefs we attach to in our mind seem almost harmless to begin with. We put faith in our insecurity and we truly believe that we can become these identities.

We start getting thinner. We improve towards the ideal of our image. However no matter how much we think we are progressing, the insecurity always manages to grow further away from us. We still don’t feel like we are enough so we continue to chase and chase and chase.

…and the rest is history. It is a horrible cycle we are all familiar with and may still be enduring.

The inflection point for a lot of us, is the moment when the pain of changing outweighs the pain of attaching to our identity. It is at this point that we realise we do have something to lose and that we do need to take steps towards changing our lives and our insecurity.

Unfortunately a lot of people do not reach this point because they are so attached to this idea of who they should become. They spend all their energy defending this image and criticising themselves, keeping them trapped and drained within their own minds. It can leave people absolutely exhausted to the point that change does not even enter their mind.

Hopefully understanding this dynamic can help you understand why our insecurities and harmful and why there are alternatives which are even more effective at motivating us and giving us aspirations.

The rest of this website hopes to explain how you can dissolve these identities and insecurities so that we can live a life based on love, happiness and inspiration.
