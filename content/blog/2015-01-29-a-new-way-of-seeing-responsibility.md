Many of us would like to think that we are responsible.

To be responsible is to suggest a level of control that is inherent within ourselves. It is a sign of moral integrity, to the things in life that we consider worth fighting for. We have this desire to project and own duty, as an innate aspect of our humanity.

More often than not however, we buy into this 'notion' of responsibility without taking the time to try and understand its vital framework. The issue is that most of us tend to associate our overriding sense of responsibility with the way we feel, such as our desire to protect our family or help a friend in need. In return for this feeling, we unconsciously neglect the process and logic which gives responsibility power.

While relying on our feelings can work to an extent, it can also cause us to idolise our actions and behaviours, without hoping to understand our motives for what they really are. This means that we can end up doing a) things that aren't necessarily beneficial because of what our feelings have told us and b) result in confusion when we do experience negative emotions, because of the actions we take.

In fact, most people fail to describe the process and logic behind how responsibility works. Instead, responsibility is viewed as an obligation or a tradition based on past behaviours and egos of others, rather than something we should try to negotiate with. It is a very distant and potentially harmful way of experiencing life.

By adopting a new way of seeing responsibility, we can be sure to have even more control and moral integrity within our lives, without the pain of due process.


### **Understanding responsibility.**


This very idea of responsibility is a very difficult concept for us to empathise with, since it is something we usually base our feelings on, rather than our logic. The logic of responsibility is simple at it's core, however learning to adopt it usually tricky.

It is as basic as this: We live in a world of actions and consequences. If you proceed with an action, then there is an equal consequence. This is the basis for responsibility, which is a far cry from how most of us have come to [use our morals](http://perspectivetheory.com/theory/the-importance-of-emotional-neutrality-164/) to dictate the way we should think and act.

Sounds simple, I know, however it's something we seemingly avoid in our lives because we're so prone to putting all of our power and judgment into our feelings and emotions. Instead of addressing our actions to change our consequence, we end up changing our symptoms in the hope that our consequences will follow.


### How responsibility works.


In a very simple example, you may be overweight (consequence) because you eat too much junk food (action) and as a result, this may bring a lot shame and guilt into your life (symptom). Of course, we don't see our unhappiness (symptom) in terms of what is causing it aka overeating junk food (action).

Instead, we see our consequence in terms of how we feel and what we can do to address these feelings, the symptom, rather than the underlying actions of eating too much junk food which is causing us to be overweight. As a result, we choose to eat more junk food in order to fulfil our emotional desire and subdue our feelings.

As we can see, relying on our feelings doesn't allow us the opportunity to apply logic and reasoning to our actions.

Of course, our feelings do not necessarily have to come from one specific consequence. In fact, you could be feeling guilty and shameful about a whole number of different things, which is why responsibility based in logic is even more important to consider.


### **Gaining responsibility through acceptance.**


It is one thing to understand that life is a series of actions and consequences, however once you're stuck in a destructive cycle, such that of emotional binge eating, then it can be very difficult to think logically at all.

One of the ways in which we can learn to become responsible within our lives is to become accepting of who we are so that we can learn a new way of seeing responsibility. Acceptance in its rawest form is an avid form of responsibility. If you truly accept who you are, the way you are, then there is no need for feelings of  guilt and shame.

Furthermore, by accepting our circumstances, we can not only step outside from our emotions, however it can help us denote an honest perspective required for responsibility to be effective. Arguably, acceptance is a poor word because it delivers a bad set of connotations. Acknowledge is a much more suitable word to use. Of course, this is an entirely different topic for another time which I shall be addressed in future articles.


### **Breaking free from denial.**


Unfortunately, many people have a difficult time acknowledging who they are, because they are locked into a state of denial. When you are depressed for long enough, it is easy to forget what happiness is or means to you, let alone the possibility that happiness exists. It is in these times that we can barely think in terms of our own actions and consequences, let alone what we're gong to have for breakfast that morning.

To a large extent, this idea of challenging our delusion is a very scary aspect in our lives which keeps us trapped in fear and denial. Of course, this is topic I hope to cover in future articles, however for the time being I hope you've learnt a little something about the way responsibility operates.

Developing a healthy sense or responsibility is a gradual process that’s acquired through a better understanding of the way we use our emotions in conjunction with our logic. By learning to accept ourselves, we can help bypass our emotions once they've trapped us within our own self-defeating cycles.
