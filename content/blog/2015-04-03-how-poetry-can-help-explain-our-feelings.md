Today's article is going to be a little different.

I have been going through some tough times recently and my mental health has deteriorated as a result.

I quit my job due to the way I was being treated, my hard drive decided to fail spectacularly on me and the list continues on down to my knees.

<!-- more -->

Perhaps the most pressing issue however is that my ex decided to contact me out of the blue, just after I had completely forgotten about her and the whole situation has triggered me quite horribly.

Of all the bad and traumatic events that have transpired in my life, my first relationship is still something I have not quite been able to deal with. Despite previous attempts in the past, I have come to realise that letting go is sometimes necessary and this is in-spite of trying everything else.

Unfortunately we have this negative synergy together that affects me poorly and it is something that has failed change.

On top of all this, I used to experience severe delusions in regards to her and while I have largely recovered, it is something I feel I will always be vulnerable to.

After about a week of sporadic conversation, I simply decided to block her out of my life and I have not looked back. There is still that part of me that wants to keep in contact, however I know it is just my delusion speaking.

I am writing this article for a number of reasons.

Firstly, I would like to give hope to those who are currently suffering from some form of delusion, whether it be with obsession or traumatic images from the past.

It is completely possible to move on in-spite of the challenges, not only without any amount of fear and worry, but also without regret.

I personally thought it could not be done and it took me many years before I even managed to grasp my delusion, however I promise with perseverance and a kind heart, through acceptance and empathy, we can overcome any sort of battle within our own minds.

In our conversation we both cleared up a lot of the misconceptions we were dwelling on and it inspired me to write a poem, or a short story if you will, that best describes my feelings in regards to delusion.

You could say that I used to have obsessive thoughts about my ex for a very long time, along with the accompanying suffering, however it is something I have gotten over in recent months.

It used to be constant, however now she simply does not invade my thoughts. It honesty feels like a miracle, however I know it is because of all the hard work I put into my mental health.

Delusion is the most horrible thing in the world and I would never want anyone to experience the kind of pain that it drags your mind through.

Anyway, I try to explain my experience in detail within the following and text I hope it is something which you can find useful for your own journey and even use to relate to your own struggles.

The basic context is that she had severe mental health issues and depression (hence hollow bell) and that a lot of our issues resulted from a lack of communication.


### hollow bell.


I compare it to the feeling of a hollow bell that rings endlessly, tearing and agitating at the fine fabric of sanity we try to hold in place.

The bell charms you with it's beauty and promise, only to remain secretly dormant in the guilt of it's own shadow, shrouded by the kind of hopelessness which sucks you in and never lets go.

You diligently wait for the bell to ring, dallying with the idea of it's grace and potential, yet never does it transpire into any sort of transgression.

You give it hope, love, every inch of your happiness and encouragement, yet it remains completely unaware of your existence, as if stuck in a world of it’s own.

In actual fact, you are ultimately insignificant to the bell.

It only takes notice of the subtle intricacies in it's long, unforeseeable shadow; cast feint into the distance, lost vast in the great expanse of darkness where no light appears.

You try and try and try and yet the bell only manages to erode our hopes and expectations into a violent orgy of miasmic drama.

It begins to invade our ability to function, like an elegant virus seeking nothing more than to remind us of our incapacity to create logic and emotion. The resulting sense of emptiness and confusion eats away into our souls, destroying all sense of self and fortune.

We start provoking the bell out of frustration, hoping it will produce sound. We push ourselves towards insanity and yet the bell only knows to take, piece by piece, the fragments of our soul we carelessly allow to be devoured and thrown away.

Initially the exchange is voluntary. It makes us happy to share our lives and embrace our future with the bell.

However it soon evolves into a grave necessity for insanity, as we see our former selves wither away into what we thought would be simple and divine.

Subconsciously the bell thrives on our vulnerability, consuming and teetering on the madness you succumb for the false sense of future you believe in so rigidly. It desires pity. It is mad.

You even become willing to wait your entire life to see it happen.

Unfortunately nothing happens and we create doubt within our own minds; the bell symbolising failure and regret.

We begin to feel guilty about not doing or being enough. We begin to think that maybe it’s because we lack of faith in our pursuits or that we are physically at fault, which the bell won’t speak to us.

So we start worshipping the bell and in all our delusion, beg it to speak our name, just so we can redeem the failure and worthlessness with which we have come to cultivate.

We stretch ourselves between guilt and pride, wearing what little we have with fallible shame.

Soon we notice that the bell holds complete control of us.

In our dilemma, we realise we can either walk away from the situation in a complete state of dyslexic panic, forever tarnished and mired in guilt, or we can continue to surrender ourselves to the bell along with all our hopes, dreams and aspirations.

Of course, our only aspiration at this point is to hear the bell ring and it's the only story we play in our minds.

Yet the process is grueling. Nothing we do works. It literally becomes the most unbearable feeling in the whole entire world and we suffer immensely.

To cope we sing our own little tune. We try and give our own desperation hope and meaning, imagining and mimicking what the bell would sound like if we could hear it ring.

We live in a perpetual dream state, endlessly orgasming at the possibility which we once promised to ourselves; that beautiful ring of our gorgeous bell.

It is a world without stress where we don’t feel useless or worthless. It is logical serene. Finally.

We give ourselves up into this fantasy, and we don’t mind if it completely devours our ability to comprehend the thoughts and emotions we once owned.

We just want to feel loved. In fact, it’s all we’ve ever wanted, only we're too blind to see beyond our own desperation.

Reality begins to agitate us. It no longer lives up to our expectations in line with the fantasy world of our tune. We cope by continually returning to our happy place where the sky is blue and the tune is perfect... just as we first imagined it would be.

Our delusions grow larger and grander.

We become so attached to this idea in our imagination that we let it consume us, well beyond the actual bell itself.

We hollow ourselves further and further, chasing this addictive fantasy in our minds, as we rapidly dissolve and lose everything we once were.

We become ghosts, living only as gods in our mind. Eventually we become the very bell we once desired, hollow and devoid.

For the bell was never capable of sound.

We focused so much on the potential and the imagined identity of what the bell was in our minds, that we failed to realise it was actually hollow all along.

It was all one big ruse, a fantasy we cultivated like candy, a process of exhausting hope for the love and self-worth we never truly had within ourselves to see the bell for what it was: Hollow and soundless.

Like the greatest deception that ever lived, we too disappear into our shadows, focusing only on what is left in the darkness; the made up tune we play in our minds like a pied piper to all the other dreamers out there.

We pretend until there is nothing left and then we disappear.

Just like a hollow bell… just as we always wanted.
