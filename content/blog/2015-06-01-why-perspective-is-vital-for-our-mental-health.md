Perspective refers to the way we view the world.

It is a point of view that has been developed from the wisdom we have gathered from the perspective and knowledge of others, as well as from our own life experiences.

It assists in forming our attitude towards life, and we all have a number of different perspectives which fluctuate depending on a range of factors.

Understanding how we create and reinforce these perspectives is fundamental to help us better understand how our mental illness functions.

Mental illness is a perspective that we create over many years, and thankfully is also something which we have the ability to control and influence. The primary issue is that we tend to influence our illness in a way that reinforces it, rather than dissolves it.

This relates to the kind of perspectives that we are exposed to in life which we can better understand by breaking down our thoughts, beliefs and emotions so that they can become more apparent and aware to us.


### How we create perspective.


It can help to think of perspective as a consequence of the way we perceive the world. We are constantly absorbing information from the world around us as our brain is wired to process everything we hear, smell, see, touch and taste: all in real-time.

We process this information on a conscious and unconscious level, and to varying intensities dependent on how we have developed our life perspective. We shape our views of the world, or our perspective, from the events that we have come to experience in our life.

These perspectives can create certain thoughts and emotions within us, and if our experiences are strong and consistent enough we can eventually generalise these experiences into beliefs that we define within ourselves.

If we consistently experience positive and bright perspectives, then these will mould into the way we view the world. In other instances we can view the world as a very dark and gloomy place through the range of negative experiences we might have gone through in life.

It can help to understand that we tend build upon these perspectives, which is why it is a slow transition from pessimism to optimism is important as we slowly erode and challenge the beliefs and assumptions that have formed over time.

We tend to seek positive experiences if our experiences in life are positive, and vice versa with our negative experiences. In a lot of cases it is merely design with the expectations of our environment, along with the influence of our circumstances as well that changes our experiences.

From our conscious point of view we can feel as if our own perspective is largely personal and because of this that we can feel as if our perspective is largely unique to us. While this is technically true, this is not to say that our perspectives cannot be structurally similar. This is in part why there are a number of common cultures such as punk, emo etc.

Like how there are thousands of different skyscrapers, that is not to say that each skyscraper is particularly more unique than the rest. When we focus on the utility as opposed to the aesthetic, we are actually all quite similar as human beings.

Specifically, our traumas do not make us unique in the sense that most people would react in equally extreme ways if they were subjected to similar experiences. There is a capacity within us all to empathise and understand mental illness, even if we may not be able to relate to it directly.


### Perspective and mental illness.


Perspective itself is neither good or bad.

It is simply different outlooks that we can have on life, and our mental illness is the result of having an exaggerated or distorted view of reality. In other words, we can manage to develop distorted perspectives because of the particular events that we have experiences in life.

When we experience something traumatic, especially on a consistent basis, then it can mould into our perspective of the world as well as our expectations of reality. This can commonly lead to delusion or denial as a way of dealing with the negative emotions of our mental illness.

What is more problematic is that we tend to seek similar perspectives as an extension of the way we currently view life, and so can naturally become more mentally ill over time. In most cases it is not until things become entirely unbearable or reach an extreme that we will garner the courage to begin questioning the assumptions and beliefs which cause us this excessive emotional pain in our lives.

Finding the courage to question our mental illness is perhaps the most fundamental step in beginning the process of recovery and because of our denial and delusion it is something which we protect ourselves from ever considering.

This is not to say that we are helpless, merely that there are a number of different challenges that we have to face and which self-awareness and alternative perspectives can help us in overcoming them.


### Adopting open perspectives.


The beautiful thing about life is that our perspectives are constantly changing by the minute.

It helps to think of our perspectives as a sort of a video tape that is constantly being rewritten constantly. If we constantly expose ourselves negative perspectives all the time then that will imprint itself into the film and entrench itself into the way we think and feel about the world.

Furthermore, it's a relatively automatic and unconscious process that we largely remain unaware of, even if we can sense that something is not quite right.

It can seem as if we are not changing, we are only exposing ourselves to the same perspectives each and everyday. This means that we naturally sit in a narrow or limited point of view within our life, contrary to the values of empathy.

The idea is that we want to slowly replace these negative experiences with positive ones so that we can slowly change the film in our tape to play something that is more hopeful, and learning and discovering the range of different strategies and perspectives to do this is vital for our recovery.

Thankfully, this is the very idea of this website- to provide people with the perspective and mindfulness required to do these things.

The hardest part of any process, especially recovery, is trying to discover the best technique involved to achieve our outcomes and when we are lost and clueless we can simple assume that we are lost.

In any case there are a lot of mindfulness exercises that we can embark on that can help us discover empowering perspectives in our lives and embarking on our journey to become self-aware is a good place to start.
