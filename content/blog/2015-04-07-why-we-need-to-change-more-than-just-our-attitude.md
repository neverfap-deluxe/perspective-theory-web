I often write about the importance of understanding and changing the attitude we have towards life.

Without the right attitudes we simply cannot function to the best of our ability and even if we do convince ourselves to pursue our goals and ambitions through force or pressure, the momentum is usually short lasted and our efforts eventually fall apart.

An issue that a lot of people have is that they think their attitude is the answer to everything. They believe that if they can keep a positive attitude, that they can effectively reach all their pursuits.

This is very dangerous way of thinking that leads directly into the hands of delusion and irrational behaviour patterns.

More important than our attitude, is our ability to critically think about how we use these tools to assist us in gaining and maintaining perspective in the overall scheme of our goals.

Simply being optimistic is not enough.

We need to have a viable strategy in place to assist us with our goals, we need to have a way of changing this plan when our circumstances change, including the hundreds of other things that have an impact on our ability to influence our lives.

When we put all our faith into our positivity, we negate our ability to think and as a result, we allow our emotions and feelings to guide us where logic should take it’s place.

Ideally the two should work in conjunction. We should be using our emotions and feelings to motivate us, while using our logic to direct us.

What has become problematic is that we can put all our faith in our positivity or our negativity to carry us through our lives. We negate our ability to think and simply allow our emotions and feelings to guide us.


### Understanding attitude.


Attitude is a wonderful thing.

Our attitude can offer us a way to push us forward, to motivate us and keep us interested in the things we are passionate about or want to achieve.

It can be completely empowering, just as it can make us feel like we are completely hopeless when we adopt attitudes of pessimism.

When we put all our faith into our attitudes, we simply become victims of circumstance, which gives us no control to direct and manage our mental health effectively.

It means that when we become sad, we inherently believe it is because we are born this way or because we cannot control our circumstances. The sad goes with our happiness and any other emotion we experience.

Furthermore, our attitudes can just as easily turn from a state of optimism to pessimism, leaving us vulnerable to our own emotions. They can be completely fallible when used in the wrong context and particularly when used exclusively.

Alternative if we can think of our attitude as a tool to be used and understood properly, rather than a holistic system which can fundamentally give us all the freedom we need to be effective, then we can aim to address many of the dilemmas that excessive attitudes can cause.


### The abuse of attitude.


One of the ways with which attitude can be abused is in this idea of positive thinking.

It is this idea that if we constantly subject ourselves to a positive mantra, perhaps through daily positive quotes or even in our own minds, that we can constantly maintain happiness all the time.

The first issue is that the only way to truly make this effective is if we put our faith into this idea and idolise this way of thinking by creating it in an identity of who we should be, attached to how it should make us feel.

That is, someone who is happy due to positive thinking.

Not only is it a false expectation that we place upon ourselves, which is harmful, however when this mantra eventually does fail and we do experience any amount of sadness, we immediately judge ourselves and self-criticise ourselves for being effective failures.

We criticise ourselves for not being the identity of who we think we should be in our minds, which makes us feel guilty and shameful.

By relying on our positive attitude, we negate our ability to act effectively and logically.

Through self-awareness however, we use things like attitude to help us better understand ourselves and embrace our emotional and logical side, rather than blindly mask who we are without even knowing it.

One of the brilliant things about self-awareness is that there are thousands of different ways with which we can allow ourselves to be self-aware and each tool has it’s own benefits in creating perspective and gaining insight into our lives.

Attitude is undoubtedly one of them, however it needs to be used properly.

This is also part of the reason why I spend a lot of time writing about context, because it allows us to truly understand not only the process of how to overcome our mental illnesses, but also the reason why.


### Thinking critically.


When we put all our faith into our attitude to guide us, we can completely forget that we can control, shape and mould every single aspect of our attitude as we see fit.

We are only victims of circumstance if we choose to.

Understandably we can be going through tough times, however that does not mean that not mean that we must be pessimistic by default.

We can choose to take ownership of our circumstances and turn it into something that isn’t an entirely lost cause. There is always leverage, even if it may seem pointless or meaningless to us.

Of course, this is a lot easier said that done and when we are going through something difficult and we are  stuck in deeply pessimistic mindsets, then obviously the momentum of negative we create can become very hard to overcome.

When the world is dark and scary, exercising and eating healthily does not feel like something which is going to immediately change our point of view.

On the contrary, when we are feeling on top of the world, we feel unstoppable like nothing can bring us down, including things which may contribute towards our depression like negative thinking patterns.

While there is hope to change these kinds of situations, they mostly arise when we improperly use things, such as attitude, which causes us to lose perspective of our mental illness and spiral down.

We need to think about all these things from a critical perspective so that we are not abusing or idolising the ideas of perspective, perhaps as an easy way out or because we are none-the-wiser.

Our ability to critically think is fundamentally more important, though we are always going to make errors along the way.

Always keep trying.
