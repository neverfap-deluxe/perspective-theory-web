Humans are a reflection of their own beliefs.

It is through our beliefs that we come to form the basis of how we understand reality. It helps to think of our beliefs as a series of agreements that we make to ourselves, to give shape and structure to the way we live our lives.

When we choose to believe something, we are essentially saying that we accept it to be true or as part of existence. It is through our beliefs that we confirm who we are as people.

Faith on the other hand gives life to our beliefs. Faith commits to the belief, while the belief is the commitment. When we believe, that is to say we give faith.

It is only once the structure of our beliefs is distorted, that they can be used to harm us and deceive us from the reality that truly exists in front of us.


### How we distort our beliefs.


Whenever we make judgments it is as if we are forming our beliefs in real time.

When we make a judgment in our minds, we essentially commit ourselves to a verbal thought or notion, whether we realise it or not. People say judgments are just meaningless and entertaining thoughts in our mind, however our brain cannot distinguish this.

When you say or make a thought, it imprints this logic into our minds based on our understanding of language. If we keep making these same thoughts, then they form into behaviours and eventually habits.

The issue with people who are overly judgmental and critical, is that these thoughts eventually end up affecting our ability to exercise and uptake rational, beneficial beliefs.

It is only when we feel compelled to constantly make judgments that we have an issue. As a result, we end up making a lot of incorrect assumptions based on our cynicism or optimism, which ends up underpinning our beliefs.

Once this judgmental attitude forms into habit, we end up creating so many incorrect beliefs based on so many incorrect assumptions, for the sake of fulfilling our habits, that we naturally end up in a bad logical and emotional place.


### Investing in our beliefs.


Upholding excessively negative or positive beliefs through our judgments requires an extraordinary amount of commitment to uphold. This translates into energy, time and our personal power.

This is why people who are self-critical and judgmental end up feeling drained and self-defeated, because of the amount of energy it requires to ruminate on their beliefs.

If they have the belief that they are not good enough, then there is the constant requirement to criticise themselves and beat themselves down.

This is why it is important to refrain for emotionally investing ourselves into our judgments and instead, use our thoughts and rationality to dictate our behaviour.

Of course, this is largely difficult because the issue is structure and why refraining from being excessively judgmental is a much more useful preventative measure.


### When our beliefs fail us.


The reason why we pursue these harmful beliefs is because of the images and identities we attach in them in our minds.

Even if we may not agree with our beliefs and regardless if they lead to guilt or harm, when we become so attached and engulfed by the image of who we should be because of our beliefs, then it feels like we are really playing this character.

We put so much faith into these images and identities because they feel real to us. If we feel like we are not cool enough, it is because believe in the image and identity of ourselves that we are inferior.

No longer do we care about the consequence of our actions, only how we can fill this void within. We chase this image, assuming it will make us feel better about ourselves, driving us to do things that are harmful and do not make us happy, only so we can live a false dream in our minds.

We know that it is harmful, yet we cannot quite commit at letting go because we become fearful of our emotions. We still have so much faith in these images and their value that we completely ignore the reality of the situation and pretend that everything is okay.

Unfortunately, it is usually only until things become particularly dire that we decide to do something about the delusion warping our minds. We realise that something is wrong, though we are not quite sure.


### How to maintain effective beliefs.


Like any situation regarding our emotions and wellbeing, honesty is the best policy of coming to any sort of consensus. If your beliefs are based upon dishonesty, then there will be a discrepancy in your logic and thoughts, which will always result in emotional dissonance and suffering.

By being honest with the nature of humanity and the way the mind works, we can then maintain a more meaningful and understanding relationship of who we are.

Beliefs are certainly not evil, however when we believe in things, particularly in ideas and identities, then we can have a difficult time understanding our irrational behaviour. It is important to understand that judgmental attitudes are merely a symptom, rather than a cause, though judgmental attitudes can reciprocate and exacerbate our beliefs.

Ultimately, in order to have honest beliefs, we must learn to dissolve the images and identities we have in our mind so that we are essentially living in the present and making decisions no based upon who we think we should be, but rather on the decisions and actions we make in the present moment.
