No doubt there are people out there with privilege.

…and boy, does it make us mad. It makes us feel cheated, like life is this inherently biased casino that is always out to get us. As unfair as things are, we feel like we should be more deserving of our circumstance and situation.

In a lot of cases this is certainly true and I do not blame people who have these feelings. However, it does not mean we must be hopeless to our own emotions.

One thing we never think about is the privilege that we have ourselves.

Perhaps the most outstanding privilege we all have is life itself. Being alive, conscious and intelligent is a privilege beyond any other species. In the entire emptiness of space, you, a minuscule spec in the universe, has the ability to breathe oxygen… and eat pizza. My gosh.

Of course other creatures have the ability of flight or can live underwater. The fact that we are intelligent does not make us special or better than the rest of the infinite number floating molecules out there, it simply gives us the privilege to do many things.

After all, the whole point of having a privilege is so we can accomplish things.

When we are pessimistic, we focus only on the things that we cannot do. We think about how helpless and pointless and painful the process of life is, rather than all the possibility in the all privilege we have.

This ultimately comes down to a failure of gratitude which is an important skill to learn.


## Why we should not take privilege for granted.


Very few of us take the time to think of the privilege we have in our lives, not only in direction, but also in scope.

In fact, few of us even think about any amount of privilege at all. We focus all our attention solely on what others have, rather than the things we already have.

Health is a privilege that people never think about. We live our entire life being healthy, and we become limited to our own experience and take it for granted. If you have arms and hands, you have the ability to do so many wonderful things in life. Without our legs we would not be able to walk.

Because these things have always just been there we develop not only the unhealthy expectation that they will always be there, but more importantly that they should be there.

We become so influenced by everything that we see on a daily basis, that we generalise everything we see and mould it into our point of view. That is why magazines and television is so effective, because they throw images at us which shape the way we see the world.

The problem with privilege is that we become completely self-centred and narcissistic about how the world relates to us, rather than simply seeing the world as it is and ourselves a character in the world.

We become so unable to see beyond our thoughts that we remain trapped within which we cannot see. We take what other people have personally and focus all our attention on our limitations and insecurities, rather than on our strengths.

Eventually we end up comparing ourselves to others and living through their images, rather than our own personal value and strengths.

We degrade our sense of self-worth to keep with the narrative that we are not good enough or that we should feel guilty because of the past.

We take everything personally and internalise all the negativity in our lives. What privilege is there in feeling hopeless?


## Keeping an open mind.


By keeping an open mind on things it can help us better empathise and not take personally our own emotions and circumstance.

It helps to understand that privilege is a feeling first and foremost. By internalising our lives and our cirumcstances, we focus only on the feeling of being underprivileged, rather than the logic of privilege at all.

We allow our emotions to dictate our actions and as a result, we lose perspective of who we are by trapping ourselves into a victim mindset. We back our emotions with the convincing stories that we play in our minds to make the narrative appear real.

This is why we must dissolve all these aspects of the psyche so that we are dictating our own emotional rather, rather than learning to internalise external events into ourselves.

We need to focus less on what we do not have and more on the kinds of privilege that we all have. We all have the ability to do amazing things and even it should be a point of contention to work together, rather than against.

Part of keeping an open mind is to admit that we are entirely wrong with everything we know. By practicing humbleness and acceptance and humility.

Practicing gratitude is also a fundamental skill which we can easily practice everyday by listing what you are most grateful for the day.

I usually find this is a good skill to have whenever I lose hope and I am looking to get my life back on track.

Through self-awareness there are so many different ways for us to help ourselves and learn to live happier more fulfilling lives.
