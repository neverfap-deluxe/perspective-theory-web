Our emotions are largely misunderstood in the context of mental illness.

When we are feeling depressed or deeply hurt we can allow our emotions to consume us and disconnect us from the thoughts and logic in our minds.

With our emotions amplified and chaotic, a hopeless narrative can take control of our perception and blind us from discovering any amount of clarity in our lives.

While this is largely understandable it does not mean that we are helpless or that we cannot regain control of our emotions.

One of the major issues with people suffering from depression is they end up taking their emotions personally at face value.

This effectively means that they surrender themselves to their emotions and allow them to dictate every single aspect of their function. With a correct understanding of how our emotions function and how they serve us we can prevent ourselves from falling into this trap.

Many of us fear our emotions because we do not understand them, especially if we are excessively emotional people, but this does not have to be the case.

When we do not take the the time to understand how our emotions function, like the cause for emotional flatlines, we can easily make mistakes of judgment and we cannot hope to master our mental health.


### How we sabotage our emotions.


Our emotions function as a dynamic systems that are constantly fluctuating, much in the same way as sound waves.

We can have waves that begin really high and then crash really low before returning to their original state. Our mood may perpetually be low or maybe even high. There is a whole range of configurations that are constantly changing.

One of the harmful ways with which we try and influence our emotional configuration is by manipulating and micro-managing our emotions through exaggeration. It is in this way that we actually make our emotions control us giving them this kind of significance over our lives, allowing our emotions to dictate the way we feel and behave.

We keep ourselves feeling positive, we decided to constantly consume positive information on a daily basis in the way of inspiring quotes or we try to use fear as a way to get us to diet and exercise.

Unfortunately our emotions do not function well based on this form of imagery where we try and convince our minds to believe otherwise. It's one of the reasons why people fail diets after a few days or return back to their negativity within a heartbeat.

While there are numerous reasons, one of the most significant drives is that our brains crave variety. Too much fear or too much positivity simply cannot maintain itself and requires more and more input to become effective. This usually causes us to burn out.

Furthermore, exaggerating our emotions simply does not spark the curiosity required to maintain the way we feel.

Instead, we need to take a step back and think of our emotions as a response to our actions, thoughts and feelings - rather than something which we can directly manage and manipulate. If we can learn to build a valid sense of self-esteem, then we can have the confidence to maintain control over the way we feel, even if our emotions are dragging us down.

Slowly over time however, our habits influences our feelings which influence our emotions which means that we can eventually tame our emotions not to become so wild.


### Emotions are like blinker lights.


Many of us think of our emotions as concrete structures that are the basis of our reality.

In actual fact our emotions function more like blinker lights in the sense that they are merely trying to indicate how we should feel and act, rather than determine our destiny. If our emotions were truly concrete structures, then we would not have the ability to change the way we feel and certainly our visions and thoughts would have no influence on the way we feel.

The reason why our emotions seem so powerful is that we constantly solidify this paradigm in our minds.

When we allow ourselves to become carried away by our emotions, this directly influences the way we think and as a result, we corrupt much of the logic in our thoughts which causes us to feel irreparably irration with all our decisions.

Since we have corrupted our logic through our emotions, this has also affected the ability for our blinker lights or our emotions to convey information accurately. Our emotions become exaggerated to the point that we feel incredibly sad for no particular reason, and completely lethargic when we take actions that make us happy.

When the feeling of depression overwhelms us, it can make sense inour own minds to adopt a hopeless state of mind, especially if we are inexperienced with our depression.

However it is important that we do not take our emotions personally, especially in the beginning, so that we can take the actions necessary to recalibrate ourselves to function normally and in the process, slowly return our emotions to a level that are functioning.

This means stopping back habits which may be messing with our emotional responses, such as excessive rumination and the various addictions that we may have. Of course, it is not easy, however that does not mean we cannot start small.

It is something which gets easier with time.


### Embracing change.


We all have days where we feel like we have lost hope, but that does not mean we are hopeless.

It is vital that we allow our emotions to function and do their job properly, otherwise we can only continue to abuse and harm ourselves. We can only do that if we treat ourselves with respect we deserve -that is refrain from bad habits and thoughts and live with integrity

While it is not an easy process, just as a stroke victim can learn to walk again and influence brain function, we are all capable of changing our feelings, thoughts and beliefs.

We simply need to think in terms of the process or system which contains the actions required to get us there. It may be difficult and more complicated for some, however if we stick to the steps then we certainly can get to where we want to.

Our emotions do not have to be confusing or unpredictable. With the right perspective we can better understanding how they function and regain control over ourselves.
