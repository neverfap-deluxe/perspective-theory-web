It can be difficult to discover clarity in our lives while we are depressed.

We come up with all sorts of excuses, mental barriers, limiting beliefs and false agreements to prevent ourselves from truly understanding our mental illness.

It is as if we want our negative feelings and confusion to end while readily provoking them and disguising them at the same time.

What makes delusion so interesting is that it causes us to validate our own experience and feelings to be consistent, even if it means we must fabricate or misconstrue logic in line with our beliefs and agreements.

We have difficulty identifying the truth using honest points of view. Instead we create our own truth based on the experience of our own thoughts and feelings, feeding power back into our irrationality.

We do it because we have no other way to cope with the way we feel (especially since we are confused and do not know what to feel) and more importantly, we are unaware of dishonesty at all.

As a result it corrupts the way we think, all way down to the core of best interest that we think we know so well.

We trap ourselves into a state of confusion. Even if we do suspect that our thoughts and feelings are oddly wrong, we still feel left in the dark.

How can we possibly dissect our false agreements and bad logic through this mess, if we cannot know if we are being dishonest to begin with?


### How we automate our thoughts.


It helps to understand that we are not helpless even though we may feel confused.

We still have a level of control lies within directly within our thoughts. While it can be difficult to change our emotions while they are wild, that does not mean we cannot direct our thoughts to help change them.

Our thoughts are effective because they are the first point of reference when we want to achieve anything. First we think about something, whether it be a goal and an action and then we follow it up by attempting our idea.

I know it sounds incredibly simple, however it is something we are not mindful of and largely our lives have reached a point where thought is no longer critical for our basic function.

You may not know that a large portion of our lives are lived unconscious of our thoughts. It is just once we become so accustomed to doing things automatically we allow our mental processes largely to go unchallenged.

We all take thousands of steps everyday and yet it is not something we seldom think about. How about all those millions of blinks or breaths that you have taken in your entire life?

These are all vital processes that have become unconscious and the same goes for all the negative thoughts or behaviours that we replay in our minds every single day.

We simply do and this precisely why perspective and self-awareness is so important for our mental health and well-being. It helps expose ourselves to these unconscious processes so that we can become aware of them, be mindful and eventually change them. It allows us to take back control over who we are.

We break things down and we dissect them to a point that they make sense to us. This is where perspective comes in.


### Understanding false agreements.


Before we can truly break down our agreements and beliefs there is one very important question that we need to ask ourselves, which is important irrespective of our mental state.

Need to constantly be asking ourselves what we value most in life.

When we live so subconsciously we also fail to question the purpose of our lives. We merely drift from routine to routine or we even live in a state of frustration and confusion, wondering where our sense of curiosity lies.

Without asking what we value in life we simply have no reason to change. We lack vision, we lack purpose, we have no possible solution to grasp. Instead we merely attach to the life processes of living without truly taking the time to understand and therefore appreciating what we do with our time.

It also makes it difficult to even identify the agreements we have.

By outlining your values in life, you also outline your greater purpose in your life which will set you free from your mindset.

Even if you cannot think of what you value, it helps to start with things that are universally positive and which you think will help your life. For me personally, I tell myself that my happiness is the most important value in my life and when you establish a guiding agreement that strong, it helps clear up a lot of the confusion and bickering within your own mind.

It makes things simple and easy to move on from. At the very least it creates a clear path for us to follow.

Through our values we can not only better understand who we want to become, but also better understand what we need to do. If the people we call our « friends » do not make us happy, then what purpose do they serve in our lives? Is being overweight making me happy?

It simply gives us a sense of clarity of who we feel we are in our minds.


### Breaking false agreements.


The way we dissect our false agreements is by pointing out their logical inconsistencies.

Naturally mental illness is a form of cognitive dissonance that we have in our minds and so dismantling these misconceptions gives us power to better understand and change ourselves. Outlining our values as described earlier will make it much easier to identify false agreements we have in our minds, because they will show to be inconsistent with our new values.

Simply exposing yourself to the irrationality of the logical inconsistency from a 3rd person perspective is usually enough to make us think twice about our behaviour and generally it falls apart in our mind.

All we are trying to do is acknowledge what our beliefs are. It really is that simple and we do this by asking lots of questions.

For example, I may have an agreement or belief in my mind that if I do not act or behave in certain way in front of others, that they will not accept or like me and consequently, that it would make me feel bad about myself if they were not to like me.

Firstly we can acknowledge that this agreement is largely based on a number of assumptions that cannot be proved (such that they will not like based on how I behave, as everyone is different) and secondly, I also need to ask whether this belief/agreement is in line with my values as a person.

In my case, would I be happier being myself rather than being someone who I am not? Is it possible for another person’s beliefs to affect my happiness? Should it matter what other people think of me?

Once we get down to the bottom of our logic we generally find that our beliefs are not that complex. The only difficulty is in learning to ask the right questions.

This is just one of the ways that perspective and self-awareness can help us better understand ourselves.
