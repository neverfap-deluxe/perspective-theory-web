Many of us have learnt to cut ourselves off from the world.

We do this to protect ourselves (particularly from our own emotions), because of the lack of trust we have in our lives. We may have been taken advantage of, feel dysfunctional about who we are, or cheated in some way and this has left us feeling jaded and cynical.

This protection is an active state of perpetual fear and insecurity, which we dress ourselves with and claim as confidence. We end up unintentionally harming ourselves in the name of protection. We cease being honest and truthful and we learn to manipulate or block out others to keep our fear at bay.

Ultimately, we only learn to be dishonest with ourselves and our emotions. We think by managing our emotions we can somehow live meaningful undisturbed lives. Yet we always seem to fail ourselves and lack sincerity or constructiveness in our own actions.

Alternatively, it should be in our best interest to remain open and honest with ourselves. Without hoping to be honest, we cannot hope to effectively change our beliefs of who we are, without taking our emotions or feelings into consideration.

**The problem with dishonesty.**

These situations are most prevalent whenever we chase something which we are hopeful about, like a job or a date, only to find out later that not all was as it seemed. We set ourselves up for failure, by buying into the identity of who we thought, who we should become.

We chase an identity in mind because of how we internalise success. Our ideas of success are usually influenced by others and what they believe, as opposed to what truly matters to all of us - our emotions. Without focusing on our emotions, we refrain from being honest with who we are.

The issue is that we take these identities and perceived failures so personally that we naturally end up feeling hurt. We ride the wave of euphoria when we should have been more rational instead.

Living with an identity in mind (not to be confused with a vision) is not an honest way to live. It is predicated on who we should be, rather than who we are and what our emotions, feelings and thoughts are currently indicating.

People end up 'protecting' themselves with cigarettes or alcohol or gambling and even gaming addictions to feed their high, thinking they are hopeless relative to their identity and that there are no other alternatives.

**How honesty truly protects us.**

When we learn to open ourselves up, we learn to dissolve our limitations of who we think we are. It comes down to liberating ourselves with who we truly are and more importantly, who we are able and hope to become.

If we truly hope to achieve our visions and not simply our goals, it is essential that we open up all of our emotions so that we can better understand them, rather than repress them and box ourselves into a state of fear and misconception through identity and insecurity, which we believe one day will become workable and make us feel successful, even though it continues to fail us time and time again.

Understandably, many of us still have regular contact with emotional and physically abusive people. Unfortunately, no amount of honesty is going to help you in these situations.

Honesty is seen as a form of weaknesses to people who manipulate other people's emotions and it can be used to abuse you even further. Obviously it is best to get away from these people, though we do not all have that privilege.

However in spite of our circumstances, it still does not neglect our responsibility to be open and honest to ourselves. This is where understanding ourselves and who we are, because vital to changing our attitudes and perceived responsibilities.

**How to be open with ourselves.**

Learning to be open has more to do with being skeptical, than trying to focus on this idea of the truth.

The fundamental reason why is because our truths are the end to a means in many ways, rather than the means, is because truth is merely an outcome that is made on a daily basis. It is purely individual.

There may or may not be honesty in truth, however in skepticism help define our truth to become more reflection of honesty.

The reason for skepticism above all is that is a definite process, rather than the end of our means. It is a critical process that gives truth substance and structure, rather portray failure or success through identity.

It is about understanding our depression and our mental illness of who we are as people. It all starts with understanding and what we can do to promote this philosophy within our own lives.
