**Overview:** In our search for truth and mental health we can end up becoming more confused about who we are. While we try our best to be critical, we simply end up losing perspective and reinforcing our negative thinking patterns. Why do we fall so helplessly into self-doubt while seeking constructive perspectives and why we do we feel so blind to reality?

Mental illness can sometimes feel like a perpetual search for truth.

It can make us feel as if we are constantly searching for something that we do not know exists, yet compels us to question how we may find it.

This really is to say that we can be at a stage in our lives where we are open to change of who we are and yet have no idea how to get there. This is a positive thing because it demonstrates our understanding and willingness to sort through our problems.

<!-- more -->The funny thing about truth is that we assume it encompasses some universal law about how the life should be.

We chase this idea that there is one universal source of truth with which to drink from when in actual fact, truth is an idea that comes from within ourselves and our own interpretation and perception of reality.

We become trapped within our own mindset, unable to define ourselves with the lack of answers and understanding of who we are.

I recently experienced something similar with my own mental health recently which is why I am writing this article today.

I felt incredibly stressed and under pressure from all my ambitions and in the process I failed to tie together the elements of my life into something coherent and meaningful.

Instead of being appreciative of all the opportunity I had I instead crumpled into self-doubt about who I was as a person.

The interesting thing about being stuck within these self-defeating mindsets is how truly blind we become to not only what it is we are searching for, but who we are as individuals.

While we genuinely try to be critical of our thoughts and come to some sort of consensus within our own mind, we actually tend to reinforce our negative thinking patterns instead and further promote self-limiting points of view.

We bring ourselves pain instead of clarity and it always remarkable in retrospect to observe the ways in which we intricately delude ourselves.


### Breaking away from the cycle of fear.


Often the biggest issue we have in terms of dealing with our mental illness is figuring out what to do in our confusion or paralysis.

Do we fight it? Do we try and accept it? What does accepting it entail? Do I simply assume that it will naturally subside in due time?

We maintain hundreds of these questions about how best to approach our problems and yet this state of mind only seems to further entrench our mental illness rather than alleviate us from the stress.

Eventually we reach a point of confusion where we literally have no idea what to do and that anything we do is fair game, as long as it is something.

It is a cycle we fall into because of the way in which we make endless assumptions about who we are.

We make these assumptions because we are driven by fear.

We fear we are going to be worse off in the future if we do not act on our problems. Equally we fear that by acting on our problems we may also exacerbate them for the worse.

We become trapped by fear.

In a sense however our problems have little to do with the way we feel and largely come down to the way in which we define our problems through expectation.


### Understanding how we create purpose.


Optimism is a dirty word for those suffering from depression.

It contains many connotations that simply do not fit in with the narrative of 'confusion' and 'helplessness'.

Optimism is really about managing the expectations we have of ourselves in a way that promotes mental health, rather than in the false ideals which suffocate us on a daily basis.

The beauty of optimism is that it represents a very simple idea of what is good for us, rather than a rigorous rulebook of the way in which we must live our lives.

For example, something as simple as having a lack of expectation can be considered a very effective form of hope.

People mistakenly assume that hope must be some kind of religious ideal when really it just represents a healthier way of living our lives.

The problem is that cynics naturally resent ideas such as optimism because they believe it is not staying true to who they are logically and rationally.

At the same time they overlook what staying true actually means in terms of their own mental health and how that affects the way they feel about themselves and others.

When we over think who we are and who we must be we also completely overlook the purpose with have within our lives.

More importantly we overlook the fact that our purpose is unconsciously created through our actions, not through the ideals in which our cynicism may bring.

When we live in fear and confusion we seek these negative aspects of life by obsessing over these worries and negative thinking patterns we hoard in our minds.

It is not that people lack purpose in life.

It is that they chase fear and confusion and feel inherently disgusted by who they are and yet remain oblivious as to how they can change these aspects of themselves in their desperation.

In essence we create a purpose we do not want and we blame it on what we do not understand.

For me it personally helps to return back to this very simple idea:

Actions become behaviours. Behaviours become habits. Habits become character.

Being aware of these things is vital for us to gain back control over our minds and allow us to remain mindful of who we are and how we deceive ourselves into terror.
