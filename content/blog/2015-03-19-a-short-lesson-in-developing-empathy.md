Sometimes we can find it very difficult to empathise.

Even if we feel that we are naturally empathetic and open-minded, we can still find ourselves completely absorbed within our own point of view, causing us to emphasise the irrationality of our emotions, feelings and thoughts.

It could be a feeling of frustration with our inability to complete a task or the rumination of past events to our detriment and no matter how hard we try to rationalise our feelings, we still cannot quite grasp our emotions and take control of the way we feel.

We become so focused into ourselves and our problems that it consumes us to the point of feeling trapped with who we are.

This can become even more frustrating when we are consciously aware of it and yet completely helpless to the seemingly random devices of our mind.


### When we lose perspective.


Put simply, we manage to lose perspective our mental health. As a result we forget how to deal with our emotions and thoughts in a manner that is quick and effective.

We box ourselves emotionally and logically without realising it, believing that we are empathetic when we actually we are only empathising through our own thoughts and beliefs, not outside of these constructs.

Effective empathy on the other hand, relies on our ability to think and feel beyond our own beliefs and identities, with not only an open and curious mind, but with a process to help us achieve it.

When we lose perspective of our depression, we lose an sort of effective process to help us maintain perspective and without this process, we cannot hope to keep open-minded, no matter our positive intentions.

Without a process to enable perspective of our depression, we can begin lose trust in ourselves when emotional difficulty arises. In addition we create a loss of confidence into ourselves and this does not help us achieve any amount of acceptance, empathy and curiosity.

Instead we limit our focus on our own harmful beliefs and points of view, as our only point of reference in mind.

While it can be difficult to change our situation without process, I would like to share with you something interesting which happened to me recently, having personally lost perspective of my depression.


### When empathy strikes.


Recently I had contracted the flu and my mental health had deteriorated as a result.

I felt worthless, incapable and largely gave up on all the ambition I had in my life. I began eating horribly, no longer thinking about my physical health and the list goes on.

However in my sudden curiosity, having read an article about how our brains function, I decided to start writing with my left hand.

Within a few minutes of writing, I noticed a tiny insect on my page. It would have been smaller than the ballpoint of my pen, however it instantly managed to capture my attention.

Empathy had struck.

Following it’s movement along the page, I suddenly realised how egocentric I was about my own problems in my life.

I began to think about it's purpose in life. Does it have dreams and aspirations like I do? What goes on in it's mind?

I thought about how humans spend so much time thinking about their own worries and problems, that we all seem to completely forget that there are other living things, humans and creature alike, with their own problems that we seldom think about.

It made me think about my own life and how this insect would be facing many of the same struggles that I currently face.

I then realised that this desk and my room is the very world it inhabits. How exciting it must be to be on-top of an island floating 1,000 kilometres in the sky!

I doubt this insect has ever left this room, considering how tiny it was and maybe my insect friend has never even left this desk in it’s entire life span.

Yet not once in my life have I ever thought of this desk as any sort of livable habitation. To me it is just another one of the careless “objects” in my room.

As you can tell, this insect made me think about my own life in a different and insightful way. It made me realise that there is so much more to life than what is just going on in my mind and this allowed me to think about my own life and my own problems in a different way.


### Why we empathise


We empathise not only to experience and learn from other points of view, but to apply to our own lives as well.

Our empathy can be struck out of curiosity and even random events, however when we are so boxed in our own minds, it is something which we are usually dragged into without expectation.

It can happen with the characters we observe in movies and even with the people we meet on a daily basis.

From a preventative point of view, this is why it is important not to take our own exaggerated emotions and thoughts personally.

By drawing ourselves into these aspects of our psyche and exaggeration our feelings through generalisation and distortion, we can allow them to dictate and consume the way we think, eventually leading us to lose perspective of our depression.

We may end up trapping ourselves emotionally and logically as a result, usually having to hit an emotional low before being able to regain our senses.

Empathy however does not have to be a random encounter.

We can go outside to experience nature or surround ourselves with people who we are curious to know, such as our friends. There are so many different perspectives that we can learn and discover from and even ordinary situations can be enough to evoke insight into our own lives.

Self-awareness can help us better understand these issues.
