Some people are not comfortable with the idea of becoming self-aware.

They believe it will fundamental change who they are, making them feel uneasy and uncertain about who they will become in the future.

While it is natural to have concerns in regards to our own mental health, many of these notions of self-awareness are based on common fears and misconceptions of how it will affect our lives.

In addition, pessimistic and cynical attitudes are naturally going to make even the most nobel and beneficial of ideas seem toxic.

Fear has this extraordinary power to bias the way we think. People will knowingly live within the confines of their own beliefs and thoughts, even if they are harmful and conducive to suffering and dysfunction.

Not as a way to feel loved, but because they fear of the opportunity beyond their own suffering, in favour for the comfort and familiarity of what they already know. Unfortunately this a kind of attitude which isolates people and traps them within their own limiting beliefs, unknowingly leaving them to become even more vulnerable to fear and mental illness.

When we unintentionally mask ourselves, along with our ability to freely express ourselves, we also subject ourselves to live in complete dysfunction of our capacity to live without suffering.

By addressing common fears  and misconceptions in our limiting beliefs, we can expose our worries and allow ourselves to view self-awareness as an opportunity to be embraced, rather than feared.


### Our misconceptions of self-awareness.


There is nothing to fear about self-awareness for a number of reasons.

Firstly, it does not fundamentally change who we are. As mental illness is a capacity self-awareness does not have the power to change our vulnerability to mental illness.

What self-awareness can do however, is give us the power to better understand this vulnerability and avoid falling into the traps and consequences that this vulnerability can cause in our lives.

Furthermore, self-awareness is not a permanent state of mind, nor is it a plateau that we achieve. There is this idea that we become self-aware and then as a result, we lose some of the « magic » of what it means to be depressed and cynical.

Like any mindset, self-awareness is something that needs to be maintained to a high degree and that can instantly change within a moment. Our mindsets, feelings and emotions are dynamic and constantly changing and self-awareness does not deny these facts.

If I wanted right now, I could very easily break down into depression and stay there for the rest of my life. Self-awareness is as much a lifestyle as it is an understanding. The key to stability is that we maintain this state of self-awareness, which is something which takes a lot of time and effort to master.

Self-awareness is not a an instant quick fix to our problems. In lieu of the misconception, what self-awareness can do is give us the option to be stable if we so desire.


### Why we mask our feelings.


In many cases however, people simply have the belief self-awareness is harmful and ineffective at accomplishing anything

In other words, there is this belief that through hiding ourselves and masking our thoughts, feelings and emotions that we can sufficiently protect ourselves from our emotional vulnerabilities.

Unfortunately this sort of mindset does nothing to actually address our vulnerabilities.

What it does do is create the illusion of being effective, by covering up our vulnerabilities in ways that actually empower and strengthen our insecurities. We merely become vulnerable in different areas as a result.

We become more defensive and critical as a way to protect ourselves from feeling hurt. We manipulate others through the way we act, whether it be with anger or sadness to provoke a response, as a way to feel manipulated ourselves.

We become neurotic and irrational which is hardly a solution to living happy, fulfilling lives. Of course, when we believe that we are incapable of living without suffering then naturally we will accept this neuroticism as the only way to deal with our problems.

When we mask our feelings by avoiding free and honest expression, we end up protecting the interests of our fears and insecurities, rather than what is truly in our best interest as people.

These are all limiting beliefs which need to be addressed by dissecting and exposing our limiting beliefs.


### How mental illness defines our values.


We live largely according to the narrative that we play in our own minds, which really is to say that we define our own boundaries of what we consider "natural".

When we suffer from mental illness, we define a standard of reality which is unnatural and harmful, yet congruent with the way we feel about ourselves.

Unhealthy and destructive behaviours stem as a result, which also causes us to believe that these standards are actually an honest and true reflection of who we are.

When we stay in such a depressive and cynical mindset for such a period of time, it also causes us to forget that these mindsets are created from of the narrative that we play of ourselves in our mind.

This is to say that we forget we actually have power over the narratives we play like tapes in our mind. We forget because we allow our thoughts and feelings to become subconscious in our minds, to the point that they dictate the standard that we choose to adopt.

These standards are important because they represent the values that we hold in our own lives. If we value suffering and self-criticism in our mind, then these are the traits we will worship and believe in the most.

If we value our own happiness and wellbeing the most on the other hand, then these traits will be what guide the principle and actions in our lives.


### Embracing self-awareness.


While this may seem obvious, the reason why we suffer from the mental illness in the first place is because we fail to think about these thought processes and the effects that they have on our lives.

When we do not consciously think about our behaviours, then we cannot claim to be self-aware of effectively functional in our thoughts and emotions.

Many of us live our lives in an effectively subconscious state for such a period of time that we no longer allow our thoughts to dictate what our values should be. Instead our mental illness takes control over our lives. Many of us simply find it a lot easier to play the harmful narrative in our mind as a source of comfort, even if it causes us to give up control.

Through self-awareness and perspective, we can expose these dilemmas in our mental illness and help us better understand and define who we are that is congruent with our best interests at heart.

While self-awareness cannot change the core fabric of who we are, it can allow us the chance to live a life without pain and suffering.
