I have a bit of an issue.  I have a little bit of an obsession with productivity and getting things done.

While the focus of this blog is to help people overcome their mental illness and depression, I also believe that taking the time to understand how we can fail or promote productivity in our lives can be tremendously beneficial for overcoming our mental illness.

The reason why I say this is because I believe that mental illness is a form of productivity itself.

When you think about it from a holistic point of view everything is a form of productivity. The only difference between activities that we believe to be productive or not, is in our perception of who we want to become as people.

That is to say that our goals and intentions in life define what we find productive. An ice skater would probably think that playing the flute is an unproductive use of time, just as a dole bludger would view trying to find a job as being unproductive.

This is an important distinction to make because it demonstrates the importance of honesty in our goals and ambitions.

If we do things that generally make us feel bad or negative about ourselves then generally it is because we are not being honest with ourselves or the true intentions of our goals.

If we claim that we do not mind being cynical and yet suffer from guilt and shame about who we are, then it means we have not truly accepted the premise of who we are and are not being honest with our true capacity in life.


### Why depression is a form of productivity.


What makes depression such an amazing form of productivity is that it causes us to excel at becoming sad.

When the focus and aim of our life is to reinforce self-defeating thoughts and behaviours, not only do we truly believe in this premise however we carry it out almost perfectly.

We will literally run ourselves into the ground to the point where living can feel like the most pointless endeavour that ever existed.

This is in part why people with mental illness also tend to be quite intelligent in some ways. Not smart in their intentions, but effective in their approach.

Just think about the sheer amount of energy, effort and focus it takes to truly express our guilt and sadness every single moment of every single day. It is truly extraordinary by any measure.

This is why through understanding productivity, we can better understand our own depression and understand how best to put a stop to our own delusion.


### What is productivity?


Productivity is a measure of achievement. Depression on the other hand relates to our deep seated belief of who we are.

When we are in a state of depression it is not as a simple as having merely experienced a mood swing. We are depressed because we have activated a deep seated belief about ourselves and who we should be.

For example we activate a belief that we must feel guilty or hateful because of events that happened in the past or because we are inadequate as people. We believe these beliefs so strongly and take them so personally that it becomes a consistent mantra that we play in our mind.

Once these thoughts form into habit and mould into our subconscious, we can turn these behaviours into a sport of challenge and obsession.

It is important to note that our subconscious cares little about what it achieves. It simply wants to automate all these behaviours and responses in the most efficient way possible.

That is to say that productivity has nothing to do with our feelings or intentions in life.

So instead of coming to our rational senses and rejecting our depressive behaviours, we instead find more and more reason to hate ourselves each day and ironically, our productivity gives us a sense of pride in doing so.

This is why people can remain trapped heavily trapped within their victim mindset. Not only does being productive give them a sense of a purpose, however it is something they do so efficiently that it reinforces this idea that they are capable and brilliant, even if it is making them feel like dirt.

This is why depression can be incredibly confusing it can give us a sense of positive identity while being depressed, yet just as equally it also makes us feel terrible so we feel conflicted.


### A different way of viewing depression.


Of course productivity does not have to be inherently dysfunctional. It is only through our mental illness that we have come to distort and misunderstand how we relate to productivity in our own lives.

The point of this article really is to describe how depression and mental illness functions as a capacity, rather than something complete separate from who we are as people.

This is to say that there is process in our dysfunction, just as there is process in our ability to recover and live positive and meaningful lives without depression.

If we are capable of being depressed, then we are more than capable of being content and without mental illness. What depression demonstrates is a very real skill of focus, determination and effort. The only issue is that we use these skills contrary to our own intentions.

Instead if we used that energy and focus to do good in our lives, then we can just about achieve absolutely anything we want.

Through self-awareness we can learning to identify and dissolve victim mindsets and instead promote empowering points of view of who we are.

There are a lot of things that we can do to help change and influence the beliefs and attitudes that cause our depression, however awareness is always a first step to take for beginning our journey for recovery.
