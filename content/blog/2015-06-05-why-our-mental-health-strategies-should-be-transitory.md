Learning to transition between mental health strategies is an integral part of progressing with our recovery.

Often we can remain mentally ill because of how we attach to certain perspectives which provide comfort and familiarity that may have [once been helpful in the past](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/why-we-reinforce-our-depression) but are now no longer useful.

In a lot of cases it is because we assume that self-awareness is this kind of epiphany which switches on in our minds and makes us falsely immune to our own emotional suffering.

In reality self-awareness is a gradual process of coming to understand who we are and how we function. When we put all our faith into the idea of something, we completely overlook and underestimate the true purpose of self-discovery in our recovery and self-awareness.

Instead, we use self-awareness as an excuse to continue maintaining the same kinds of narrow points of view that have been responsible for our mental illness in the first place – in the hope that self-awareness can come up with all our answers [without having to think](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/why-struggling-is-necessary-and-healthy) or put in any effort to discover them.

When we embrace the philosophy of transition however, we can work towards better understanding ourselves and our problems through a variety of different mindsets, strategies and perspectives.

It is important to consider these things because our mental illness is a very dynamic aspect of our personality which we [have yet to understand](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-have-delusion), and so there a lot of different things we must do and try.

The positive thing is that as when we master this process of transition, we can learn to live our lives with confidence and act on our problems without fear, even if we may not necessarily know exactly what is wrong with us.

Transition is as equally about change as it is about adapting and responding to our circumstances. It is about having fluidity with our mental illness so that we can [respond effectively and change](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/adopting-an-attitude-of-resilience) when things are not working out.


### The importance of thinking critically.


Learning to think critically is paramount for understanding how and when to transition.

When we discover what seems to be a complete solution to all our problems, such as religion or self-awareness, it can make us feel [as if we have been saved](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/developing-gods-in-our-lives).

Of course, this is not true as we have not yet done anything, but to finally have some sort of direction in our lives can overwhelm us. It can create hope in our lives, which can in-turn undermine all the hard work and reason required to actually make this direction effective.

Discovering God or self-awareness is not a solution within itself. These things are merely framework for change which require us to actively think about our circumstances and how to best live our lives.

When we [fall in to the trap](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/why-there-is-no-quick-fix-for-mental-illness) of thinking that there are easy solutions in life, we can overlook the actual purpose of these tools which is to promote self-discovery and growth in our lives.

Ultimately, having a framework does not provide us with the one single quality that hope cannot create itself. It can, however, provide us with the courage to question the assumptions we make in our lives.

Transition is only one part of the process which can make our recovery effective, however learning to not to get trapped [within our self-limiting beliefs](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/learning-how-to-overcome-our-limitations) is one way in which we can help ourselves.


### Embracing transition.


Transition is not a linear process. It is a process of trial and error to best determine what works for us and what does not.

An important part of transitions are learning to develop our sense of instinct in regards to our own mental health, which means [knowing when to change](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/how-we-allow-routine-to-affect-our-mental-health) and when to stay the same. What often deters people in the beginning of their recovery is the size of their problems, and how interconnected their issues are.

This can make it incredibly difficult for us to gauge if our mental health strategies are having any affect, especially if we are still feeling sad to various degrees. In essence, we need to be incredibly mindful of the way we feel and adopt new and different perspectives to help us get through these challenges.

For example, if we understand that [change is a gradual process](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/reasons-we-resist-change) which takes time because of the way our neural pathways function, then it can prevent us from giving into our addictions or bad behaviours when we are trying to change them.

While perspective is important, it's equally as important to practice self-awareness so that we can reinforce these behaviours and develop trust and control in our actions.

Practice is always key to becoming familiar with ourselves and how best to function.


### Recovery is a learning process.


A lot of people do not like the idea of leaving their mental health into their own hands. Often it is because we have had bad experiences with adopting change in the past, and so we have come to understand the world as a hard and unforgiving place.

Instead, it can help to think of recovery [as a learning experience](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/why-learning-is-fundamental-for-our-mental-health) in which will always be an element of struggle in the beginning of our recovery as we try to learn who we are.

This does not mean we have to struggle helplessly. By understanding transition we can better navigate ourselves through this storm.

Even if we feel [we are not getting anywhere](http://perspectivetheory.com/blog/the-struggle-from-depression-to-stability) we must understand that we are always learning new and different things each day and this is an important part of maintaining our mental health – appreciating who we are on a daily basis.

We need to develop a number of different strategies, mindsets and perspectives in order to address the challenges in our life, as well as the understanding and confidence to act with courage and in our best interest.
