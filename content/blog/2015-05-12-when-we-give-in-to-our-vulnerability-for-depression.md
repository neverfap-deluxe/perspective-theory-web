Sometimes we struggle to maintain our mental health.

Even if we go weeks without having suffered any kind of depressive episode, we can wake up one day to find ourselves mired in a state of uncertainty and doubt, as if hit by storm that has appeared out of nowhere.

In the overall scheme of our mental relapse, we struggle to keep our sense of purpose in life and eventually we give in to the confusion and collapse back to our bad habits which preceded our mental stability.

<!-- more -->

If we consistently fail our mental stability we can allow our vulnerabilities to define us and provide excuses for why we repeat these behaviours.

We make it out as if we were never truly destined to become mentally stable in the first place and that we are broken by design, no matter how hard we try to consistently maintain good habits.

When we do fall back into the cycle of depression that we create for ourselves, we simply excuse it as something natural or even healthy.

We stop caring about our mental health and we return back to our old habits with the expectation that in one or two week’s time, that we can naturally fluctuate back into a state of mental calm.

Even though we do tend to return back to mental stability as time passes, it is also a wasted and unnecessary opportunity for us to crash and wait weeks if not months for us to attempt the same failed pattern again.

While we think that temporarily giving up is an effective way of recuperating and gaining perspective in our lives, it is nothing more than a learned behaviour that we have trained ourselves to validate, rather than change.

Routines are aspects of our psyche that we create through repeated behaviour and when we repeat dysfunction, we naturally hardwire it into our expectations of who we are and what we are capable of as people.

We use this cycle as an excuse to claim that we are more vulnerable than others, when really it is a self-perpetrated cycle of vulnerability which we create entirely on our own.


### How we activate our vulnerabilities.


The good news is that it is a cycle that we all experience dealing with and so it is not as uncommon as you think. We consistently fail ourselves because we do not build the courage  to question the assumptions that we repeatedly make which reinforce this cycle.

It helps to think of our vulnerabilities as capacities that we all have to some degree.

For example while some people are more vulnerable to self-criticism, others tend to be more vulnerable to addiction and it varies from individual to individual.

The difference with people who are mentally stable on those who are not is that mentally stable people are able to avoid activating their vulnerabilities, while those who are mentally unstable are constantly activating their vulnerabilities without being aware of it.

This is why self-awareness is so important because it can allow us to expose the ways with which we unintentionally or perhaps intentionally make ourselves vulnerable from our behaviours and actions.

With this said, mentally stable people are generally quite lucky in that they have never had the need to be aware of not activating capacity for vulnerability, generally since they have not experienced trauma that has sought them to take addictive drugs or feel helpless about themselves.

While there is nothing wrong with being highly vulnerable, just as I am as a person, it is only when we pursue and activate these vulnerabilities that we cause issue in our lives.


### The importance of becoming aware of our behaviours.


If we remain unaware of our behaviours which cause us to become destructive and reinforce the cycles of depression, then naturally we allow ourselves to be at risk to our own detriment.

One of main reasons why people spiral into anxiety or panic attacks is because they simply do not realise how their actions are reinforcing their panic.

Instead attempting to relax or distract ourselves, we train ourselves from past experience to continue ruminating and over-thinking which merely exacerbates our panic.

It is because a) we know no better and b) because we have not trained ourselves to observe and become aware of our behaviours. Instead we have been trained to trust them as instinct.

If we are truly to help ourselves we need to take back control of our thoughts and actions, rather than letting ourselves go into autopilot.

Doing things such as breaking down our behaviours into steps or even practicing meditation, can be particularly helpful in terms of learning to become self-aware of our own thoughts and actions.

Part of the reason why meditation is difficult when we are starting out, is because it requires us to train our focus which goes contrary to the kind of subconscious thinking that we are so used to where we let our thoughts run free.

However with a little bit of practice and dedication, we can just about master anything.


### Changing behaviours.


Some of us take the view that this cycle of healthy for us to let off a little steam and that to hold in all our desires simply makes us jaded and dysfunctional.

This extends from the point of view that there is some kind of quick fix for our neurotic problems, however recovery has always been gradual process, especially in regards to the way that our neural patterns are created and reinforced over time.

While discovery is largely a process of trial and error, change is a process of consistency and commitment to sustaining the right technique once we have discovered it.

People assume that having the right technique in place does not entitle us to live without struggle, however dealing and enduring  struggle is a fundamental part of learning to recovery and discover technique.

This means gradually changing our behaviours so that we can have a positive influence on our cognitive processes and avoid triggering our vulnerabilities in the future through knowledge, practice and perspective.

The more we resist our impulses, the more we neutralise and change these feelings and they way that they have been hardwired into our brain.

The reason why many people fail their recovery is because they have this wild idea in their head that transitioning from one extreme to another is a way that we intuitively break states of helplessness and depression.

We think that radically going to from depression to stability and back again make us even more adaptable and resistant to our negative feelings. In reality this kind of neurotic behaviour can only reinforce further neurotic behaviour in the neurotic pathways that we have created.

When our emotions fluctuate and we become excessively emotional or irrational, we intuitively lose perspective of ourselves and we feel fall into the trap of self-harm.


### Leaning to accept our impulses.


Since a lot of these feelings are intuitive, it can be difficult to try and resist these impulses towards activating our vulnerability.

One effective way that can help us is to channel these impulses into positive behaviours, perhaps forms of creative art or exercise that we can equally appreciate and feel proud of.

It can also help if they are relatively laborious and tactile in nature.

Having these sorts of activities can be helpful as a way of building our self-esteem and especially as a way to train the mind to adopt new perspectives and neural pathways in regards to self-control.

These activities do not have to be complicated. They can be as simple as using a colouring book or even going for a series of structured walks around the neighbourhood.

Personally speaking I like to utilise my typewriter and it works really well for a number of reasons. Using a typewriter is just difficult enough that it does not become impossible when we are depressed, however they still require a level of concentration and dedication to use.

They are also useful as self-esteem building activities because we can see our actively see our progress via the words that are being printed onto the page with each button we push. It also allows us to observe ourselves and our behaviours  in the present moment, so it also serves as a form of therapy.

In order for these activities to be beneficial, we need to practice them on a daily basis where we are feeling depressed or stable. Being consistent is the key to effective change.

Much like how smoking one cigarette is unlikely to make us addicted, if we keep repeating this behaviour on a daily basis it will eventually form into an addiction.

It is important to realise is that our vulnerabilities are not an excuse to mistreat ourselves. Instead it helps to view vulnerability as a capacity that is in inherent within everyone and can either be activated or left alone.

Much like in the same way that we are all vulnerable to addiction, it is not an excuse to continue taking drugs or blaming or excusing our behaviours.

Learning to become self-aware can help us discover these points of view.
