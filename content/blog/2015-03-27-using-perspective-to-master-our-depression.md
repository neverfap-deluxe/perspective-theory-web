When we are in the process of recovering from our depression or mental illness, we may have a lot of ambition and good intention with the things we do.

We start eating healthier, we decide to read books on self-awareness, we slowly change our habits and decide to leave the negative people our lives.

We do absolutely everything we feel necessary to bring ourselves into a better state of mind. Yet in-spite of all this effort, we still feel inherently out of control. We still feel predisposed to the depressive side of our personality and the bad habits that follow.

The reason is because we lack perspective in our lives.

Firstly, I am a complete emotional wreck. I find it very easy to take things personally and it is part of the reason why I cry so much during movies. I am incredibly impressionable, especially in relation to the tragic and self-defeating events or narratives that play out in my mind.

Even though I understand my goals and ambitions are, why depression is bad and even the context of my depression, without perspective I simply would be unable to function.

Perspective is what pieces everything we have learnt about ourselves together.

Through perspective we have a whole range of effective emotions, thoughts and feelings to utilise and give our context and knowledge meaning.

This is not to say that we will not suffer emotionally again, as traumatic events such as death are natural and cannot be prevented, however with perspective we can not only hope to overcome any situation, but also prevent the emotional response from being more painful than it should be.

The fact is that we all go through tough times in our life, regardless of our susceptibility to mental illness or how pervasive our situation is.

What perspective can do is help us bounce back from our woes and turn unfortunate situations into something that can empower us and push us forward, as opposed to having to resort to alcoholism, repression or any other form of destructive outlet to deal with our problems.


### What is perspective?


It helps to think of perspective as a tool which we can use to assess our situation in real-time.

Perspective compromises a holistic system of thought which allows us to completely reinterpret our beliefs, feelings and thoughts at any time.

One of the difficulties of this holistic system is that there so many aspects of our personality and our mental illness that we need to study and learn before we effectively implement it, which may seem overwhelming for those starting out with their recovery.

This is why it helps to use perspective once we have taken the time to understand how our thoughts, beliefs and feelings function in relation to our mental illness.

It is only once we master these aspects of our psyche that we can become fully self-aware and in-control of who we are, irrespective of our depressive quirks.

Of course the brilliance of perspective is that we are not entirely unaware!

The fact that you recognise your own mental illness brings you halfway there to becoming self-aware! In fact, being a conscious, intelligent entity already saves you millions of years of biological evolution as well. Well done.

While it helps to master the entire holistic system of perspective, usually it is not necessary for most people. In a lot of cases it is only a small aspect of our personality that we need to address, like our judgmental attitudes or our lack of focus.

Depression is also a holistic system which is why it helps to master every aspect of how perspective functions. Unfortunately in my case I had to change just about every aspect of my personality, which is why I am so familiar with how it functions.


### Our maze of resilience.


The aim of perspective is to make us incredibly resilient with our own thoughts and emotions.

If we think of our minds like a complex and intricate maze, perspective is a tool for us to move with ease through this maze so that we can achieve the most efficient outcomes.

Neurotypical people, those usually associated with stability, can be thought of having very simple mazes. While this does not denote their ambition or effectiveness in any way, it is simply a quality of how we have been brought up.

One of the more common issues with neurotypical people is that even though their level of denial is usually less than those who neurotic, they are also less likely to be aware of their denial since it is also much more mild.

Regardless of the level of mental illness we have, with perspective we can instantly be able to identify our exaggerated attitude, beliefs, thoughts or emotions within the moment and initiate a process of change.


### Avoiding perspective.


It is understandable why people avoid perspective. People become so frustrated with their depression that they give up hope about ever overcoming it.

They feel that is has become such a complex and distorted aspect of their personality that it terrifies them to even think about it.

As a result we do absolutely everything but think about the possibility of perspective in our lives and depression. We ruminate, chase ideology and addictions; just about everything but focus on the core of our mental illness in our feelings, thoughts and beliefs.

We play into the narrative of our depression and give it power to run rampant in our lives, instead of learning to calm down and act effectively.

While I do not condemn these things, often it is simply that we do not have a choice. We become so overwhelmed and that is completely understandable.

Our focus becomes so tied to the external events in our lives that our emotions barely give us enough room to even act at a self-aware capacity.

I want to assure you that all the answers are out there. They exist in our minds, every single one of them.

With perspective we can hope to overcome even the most difficult truths in our lives.
