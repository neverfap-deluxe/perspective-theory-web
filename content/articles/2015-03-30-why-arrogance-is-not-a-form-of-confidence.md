Arrogance is a very nasty and unforgiving aspect of our personality.

On a more technical level, arrogance can be described as a failure, often unaware, in employing effective and honest communication to empathise with ourselves and others.

It is in the expectations of what things should be that we found our arrogance. We may believe to be truly greater than we are, which is a false expectation based in the exaggerated and distorted beliefs and images of what we know.

Part of the reason why we become arrogant and why arrogance can be difficult to dissolve or even be aware of is because it is usually a sum or a reflection of the experiences that we have had in life.

If our parents and the people around us have consistently told us that we are special, then it is hard to believe otherwise. It is how we have been perceived and treated and so it is what we tend to believe.

When we meet other people however who do not fit our beliefs, we immediately feel suspect. They cannot be right because they go against the majority of our experience in life.

In addition, we also attach our emotions, feelings and thoughts to this identity of who we should be.

We create judgmental mindsets to dictate our emotions, feelings and thoughts in line with this exaggerated expectation and identity. We partake in self-criticism and self-hatred to manage our identity in line with our lives.

As a result, arrogance is a particularly destructive form of delusion that embodies the very worst aspects of human pride to an intellectually dishonest image of ourselves.

Of course, do not know that this form of identity is dishonest because it is a reflection of our experience.

Even once we do recognise our behaviour, it can be difficult to change our point of view because of what our emotions, feelings and thoughts are telling us. Surely they cannot be wrong?

This is part of what keeps people in a state of arrogance. We do not want to shatter the illusion of our self-worth and specialness, irrespective of how it causes us to suffer emotionally and logically.

Through acceptance and empathy we can learn to dissolve our arrogance, along with the judgment and self-criticism, so that we can develop a true sense of confidence that does not rely on maintaining images and identities of ourselves.


### Arrogance is not a form of confidence.


As mentioned earlier, our sense of pride and the emotions associated with it is what makes our arrogance feel real.

Arrogance is actually is a substitute for something deeper, as a way to protect and guard ourselves.

Ultimately we create and live in these identities of our mind because it gives us a perceived sense of power and confidence in ourselves.

The problem is that we end up investing so much of ourselves in maintaining these false and unreal expectations of our mind, that we will do anything to maintain our pride and image.

We sacrifice our own mental and physical well-being, exhausting ourselves away to keep this idea alive in our mind. It is particularly why people with eating disorders have a difficult time.

It helps to think of arrogance as a belief of authority or superiority on a level playing field.

Confidence on the other hand is about embracing and owning who we are, by embracing our strengths and admitting our flaws. It speaks without insecurity or concern for our perception of our own thoughts.

Confidence is something that everyone has to varying degrees that can be diminished or elevated depending on the situation. It is something that we grow within us.

For example we can become arrogant when we feel a sense of excessive pride in our accomplishments, like if we manage to get a job interview or a big date.

Our limited experience tells us that we have made it, that we are special and that a result, we can accomplish anything in our lives.

While this feeling is wonderful and euphoric, it can become problematic if we take it too personally and allow our feelings and emotions drive our identity, rather than live in the moment and maintain control with our thoughts.

If we rock up to the date or the job interview and we get declined or rejected, we instantly feel worthless and because of these feelings, we actually believe that we are properly worthless.


### Dissolving the identity of arrogance.


Once your identity is shattered and you feel like you are left with nothing, as your emotions turn against you. To compensate we continually create new identities or we become self-critical and guilty to maintain our delusion.

The issue with identity is that it has no gauge for our own vulnerability and impressionability as human beings. This is why it’s important to always to appreciate a level of acceptance, rather than identity.

Arrogance is a sheer failure to accept, in place for an identity that we believe we should uphold. It is when we externalise our own emotions and feelings beyond our own control, rather than what we truly want to feel on the inside.

Ultimately arrogance cannot be a true form of confidence. Our identities only serve as masks to protect ourselves, however that they are only illusions which are easily breakable.

If we are to dissociate ourselves from our arrogance and false identities, then we must learn to expose and dissect the various identities that we have created over our lifetime.

One way of doing this is to learn not to take our own emotions and feelings personally. Other ways include to observing ourselves from a 3rd person point of view.

Through self-awareness and perspective we can take back control of our thoughts and display a level of confidence that is not bred from emphasising certain aspects of fear and insecurity, and born from self-esteem.
