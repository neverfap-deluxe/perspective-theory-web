Faith is not a religion.

To have faith is to say that you have a belief or a feeling in something, be it via your own decisions, actions or thoughts. It helps to think of faith as the logical step before optimism or pessimism.

Faith is an important aspect in our lives because it gives power to the ideas of our mind. For many people their faith revolves around their religion, however for all of us, it also envisions our goals and dreams.

Without a level of faith in our ideas, we are relatively ineffective as human beings. We place so much faith upon world in ourselves and others on a daily basis, yet many of us remain adverse to this basic logical construct.

Because of the association faith has with religion, we may neglect that it is even worthy of attention. However without understanding how we employ faith, as everyone does, it can be difficult to noticed and appreciate some of the dynamics in our minds.


### Faith is a feeling backed by our beliefs.


I find it funny how people are overly skeptical about other people’s beliefs, yet are very rarely skeptical about their own. We never seem to question our own faith, because our beliefs feel inherently real to us.

We also find it difficult to empathise with what other people are feeling, since we only have our own beliefs and feelings to go by. Of course, things begin to break down once we are confronted with other people’s beliefs which may contrary to our own.

As a result we become defensive and even aggressive when faced with such contradictions. We commit so much to the logic behind our beliefs, that we maintain that there is no other possibility to our feelings.

In other words, faith attempts to capitalise on the logic behind our beliefs and ideas, rather than on what we have in common - our feelings. Otherwise, would it not be more constructive to focus on our feelings, rather than the underlying assumptions surrounding them?

The issue is that our faith is trying to uphold our image and identity of what we believe is true. This make it very difficult for us not to take our own beliefs personally, which is why we feel compelled to react. Faith can only exist behind a mask, whereas our emotions already exist freely without these surrounding ideas.


### How does faith work?


Faith ultimately comes down to the way we feel about a belief, which can happen either instantaneously if what we experience is particularly impressionable, or perhaps over a number of years as we try to rationalise our experiences.

Sometimes we are quite happy to have our beliefs disproved, whereas other times it may deeply offend us or even hurt us to consider the possibility of being wrong.

Our feelings may be so extreme that we never dare consider the possibility of being wrong, no matter the amount of evidence being presented to us. Usually this is associated with trauma, where our feelings regarding these topics override our ability to construct logic.


### Ego gives faith depth.


Faith gives the impression of being real, because of the identity or belief it is trying to upholding.

Gods are very much images and ideas in our minds. As reality is a mere projection of our thoughts and emotions, gods exist primarily as images and identities in our minds and thoughts, and we are so convinced by these ideas that we believe they must be real.

This is why religion works at a young age when children are impressionable to ideas and identities. We are told to have faith in these image regardless of whether we truly understand it them or not.


### Is faith a bad thing?


It is important to understand that there is no aspect of the human psyche that is particularly bad. Anger, frustration, hopelessness, depression etc. cannot be labeled as bad, because they are a result of how we function relative to nature.

If we function with nature, then we will be fine. If we function against nature, then it will function against us - the result of much of the emotion pain and suffering many of us experience today.

Some people claim to enjoy the grind and rumination of their exaggerated emotions, when really it is a response to their attachment of the images and identity underpinning their faith - driven purely by insecurity.

It is important to understand how faith works, because it will help us become more attuned and self-aware to how we think, feel and believe. Observation is often the best form of therapy.
