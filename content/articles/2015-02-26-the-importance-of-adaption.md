Many of us fail to adapt to our circumstances.

We fail because we refuse to embrace the uncertainty and volatility inherent within life and nature. We become stubborn and jaded, because we fundamentally disagree with the ideology or version of reality we keep tight-knit in our head.

Instead we reach a point of self-criticism and self-doubt in our mind. It is as if we completely reject our circumstances and mal-adapt instead, to cope with what we do not want to truly know.

We end up living in this sort of idealised version of reality which does not exist. We don't accept reality for what it is- we accept it more for what it should be.

We create an impression of acceptance in disguise for what is really a complete rejection of reality and of who we are.


### Anticipating acceptance.


An integral part of acceptance is understanding the way in which life is volatile and unpredictable. Acceptance is about embracing our circumstances and allow them to exaggerate and distort who we are.

The only way to do this is if we do not take our circumstances personally. We ultimately have a choice not to take things personally, because this is also to understand that life and our circumstance is something ultimately out of our control.

This does not mean that we must be powerless and lack responsibility. It does not mean that we have no control over our thoughts and how we feel about ourselves. Understanding is a fine balance between responsibility and understanding.

In many regards this is difficult for people, considering how personal their circumstances may. It may be abuse or trauma from the past and in return, people feel like they owe themselves some form or retribution.

This retribution usually comes in the form of self-doubt and a sense of worthlessness. Because in taking our circumstances personally, we also feel like we are deserving of control over them, when we may not have any influence over them.

Doing this provides us with no advantages. Resent does not empower us, it merely brings us down to the level of our circumstances.

We all have the ability to feel empowered no matter our circumstances and anticipation and acceptance is something which can help us.

We are empowered when we embrace and understand who we are, because understanding ourselves gives us power over how we not only perceive ourselves, but how we perceive the word.


### When life runs astray.


Life doesn’t always work out as planned and this is something which can be very difficult for us to deal with. It could be something as dramatic as a failed marriage or an extremely humiliating and demoralising situation.

For most of us however, it is in the minor inconveniences life that cause emotional reactions on a daily basis, like when we miss our bus or have to deal with rude or difficult people.

These are all inconveniences that can lead us to grief and emotional pain. It could be a feeling of anger, frustration, sadness – the whole spectrum of confusing emotions and feelings.

Instead of adapting to our circumstances, we choose to exaggerate them and manipulate them to fit our ideology. We do this to cope with our emotions, rather than to truly adapt and accept.

The consequence however is that we ultimately become more vulnerable and weaker in our judgment. In failing to accept we choose to misconstrue and distort our problems beyond what they actually are.

After a while we begin to live in the reality of our minds, rather than in actual reality. We become even more cynical and jaded as we slowly discover that nothing is really as it seems; at least as it should seem in our minds.

This dissociation merely results in more emotional pain and does nothing to truly empower us in the real world. By becoming jaded, we create a world of problems rather than a world of solutions based in human biology and nature.

If we can learn to change the way we think and feel about life, then we no longer need to blame or allow our environment or circumstances to dictate the way we feel.

We can feel good and empowered about who we are irrespective of our circumstances. We can focus on our emotions, thoughts and outcomes, rather than remain creatures circumstance.


### Keeping an open mind.


The biggest issue that people have with acceptance is that they fail to empathise with their situation and their own emotions. Perhaps the most important aspect of acceptance is self-acceptance, as it all begins with how we personally feel about the world.

After years and years of reinforcing these emotional reactions to our circumstance, we no longer even need to think about doing them.

We end up relying on our emotions to the point that we actually feel the world is a dangerous and horrible place.

We longer need to rely on our thoughts to tell us that we cannot accept the world and this is part of why people who are depressed become incredibly confused about the world. They end up relying so much on their emotions that they forget how they even got there in the first place.

It is easy to say that empathy is difficult in these situations and this is part of the reason why self-awareness is so useful. It teaches us all the basic of how our emotions, thoughts and beliefs work so we can untangle the maze of the mind.


### Interpretation is not fact.


It’s funny when you study interpretation and the way that make agreements about the world.

When someone says that they hate summer, it’s not because summer is inherently bad. Everyone has their own thoughts about the weather, however it’s important to understand that it’s completely personal to ourselves.

Weather has no description or preference. It is something entirely that we create for ourselves.

It’s important to understand that we all have different interpretations about life and that these interpretations essentially encompass the beliefs that we have about ourselves and the world.

When we take these interpretations personally, particularly our own, we are essentially lying to ourselves. We allow ourselves to get worked up over an opinion, with no understanding of how this can truly accomplish any sort of tangible and constructive process.

We delude ourselves with emotions. We feel angry when we hear about injustice and we feel good when we - but ultimately we only manipulate our feelings.


### Learning to adapt.


Learning to adapt to our environment instead is a fundamental skill which can help us in every aspect of our lives. Being stubborn accomplishes nothing.

Stubborness itself is a not a form of revolution, because it doesn’t empower us in reality - only in our cognitive dissonance. Instead is simply allows nature to overwhelm us. Self-rejection can only result in emotional pain.

What we want is a constantly evolving stream of new interpretations and different ways of dealing with life.

Life is not a static entity. It is a living breathing organism that is constantly changing. With that, so does our understandings of who we are.

Self-awareness can help get us there.
