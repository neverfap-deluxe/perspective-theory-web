No one aspires to be normal.

It is not 'cool' to be normal and abnormal people seem to inspire us to become more like them. You know, the manically depressed, those with exotic sexual tastes, alternative subcultures - you know who I'm talking about.

They're different and we like it. It captures our attention. We associate normality with being dull and certainly I don’t blame people. I personally rode far into the realm of tragic romance only to develop crushing insecurities and depressions.

Fortunately or perhaps unfortunately, many of us simply don’t have the time or utility to chase these fantasies and so they remain as obsessions to our minds, wishing we could be someone else who we're not. Essentially, the problem is that we’ve managed to completely distort and confuse the meaning of what normal is and should be in our lives.


### How we have come to understand normal.


It is almost tragic when the word normal is no longer associated with its original definition. Google defines normal as: "conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected." How is this possibly a bad thing? If happiness and fulfillment is the standard, then why are we so insecure about who we think we should be?

Arguably, part of the reason for our negative views on normality is that society is transforming and evolving at such a fast rate; as if there is no normal. Just about every aspect of our society seems to be changing, from the way we communicate using technology, down to the very way we travel and consume entertainment.

It is as if society believes it is so far out of normal, that normality itself is this dangerous construct which conspires to stand in the way of progress. I doubt anyone has ever dared to describe anything as being normal, especially things that are close to them. It is considered an insult, rather than a positive attribute.

We are never told that it’s okay to be normal, because we associate normal things with being average, rather than being successful and fantastic. Well, I’m here to tell you that it’s okay to be normal. In fact, it's completely, amazingly, entirely healthy for you, like drinking water instead of coke.


### Why normal is not what we think it is.


It helps to think of normality as a canvas. A normal canvas may look bland and dull, however it allows you to paint whatever wonderful picture you like. An abnormal canvas on the other hand, one that is broken and full of holes and smudged with stains, may already look like art, but it is not because of your own talent or life.

In other words, you are not a reflection of your canvas, but your ability to make the canvas special. While trashing the canvas may make it seem cool and hip, it is also a very dangerous and unfulfilling way to express our lives.

If your life feels dull and uninteresting, then it is not a reflection of normality but of who you are as a person. To be normal is to be regular, which means having the control in your life to develop your talents and become an interesting person.


### How we have come to distort normality.


Once we pursue extremes it can also tend to disrupt the way we view our life. We become so accustomed to the ups and downs of being abnormal that we often forget there is even a normal canvas to work with.

We chase the highs and endure the lows because it's all we know.

For whatever reason, we find it perfectly horrid to be functioning and healthy, yet once we do pursue these extremes, find only pain and disassociation in it's place. Our depression overcomes us and we wonder what went so wrong with our 'interesting' lifestyles.

It helps to think of normality as a straight line. You occasionally have your highs and lows, however for the most part you remain within a certain frequency and this is not a bad thing because as we defined earlier, it is a set standard that we adhere to our lives.

This standard of normal can be anything you want it to be. It can be about being happy all the time. It can be able living with love with every inch of your being. This is what normal can be, rather than what we think it is.

With the highs and lows of abnormality however, we don't have a choice to live with any standard. We feel happy, we feel sad, we rinse and repeat. This is a self-defeating cycle and is the result of pursuing abnormality. Once we experience enough of these lows and highs, then we forget there is even a baseline and we continue to live our life with impunity.


### We do not have to be abnormal to be interesting.


Embracing normality comes back to living an engaging life. If you live a consistently engaging life that you find meaningful, then there is no need to be abnormal.

A large part of this is embracing the humility of your canvas - learning to make the most of your life. Sure, you may not have the skills and abilities to draw something amazing with your talents now, however tarnishing your canvas isn't going to give you anything meaningful, even if it gives the impression of being art.

Often though, the reason why we destroy our canvas, is as a way to push ourselves forward. Sometimes it is not until we hit rock bottom that we are encouraged to change our lives to become more interesting and engaging people, and this is a sad reality for many of us.
