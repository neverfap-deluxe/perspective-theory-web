I have a theory that hopes to explain the kinds of people who suffer from depression.

It focuses on what we all have in common, in-spite of all the differences that we may have in terms of intelligence, cultural circumstance, gender and even age.

Having written about depression for a while now, I have noticed a common theme in the pursuit of depression, not only in my own life but in my friends as well.

What I have discovered is that those who tend to suffer from depression are individuals who desire ambition.

It could be ambition in any form and our ambition is completely relative to our level of intelligence, who we are and just about everything else that we could classify us as human.

It could be in our pursuit for happiness, to be able to successfully pay our bills on time, to create a thriving business, to find a loving partner, to have a pleasant walk down the street - there are so many different facets of ambition that we all hope to pursue on a daily basis, much of it unconscious to our minds.

A large part of which causes our depression is in the perceived failure of these ambitions. Rather, we often confuse the cause of our depression with our ambition, however this is incorrect as we will find out.


### Two types of people.


As a result of this understanding, I believe that there are two types of people in life.

There are those who are unaware of their own future/ambition (those with no ambition or at least a failure to acknowledge ambition) and those who are consciously aware of their future/ambition (those with ambition).

For those with no ambition, nothing truly matters from a long term perspective. People live in-spite of the overarching consequences of their actions.

While this may be a cause for depression, it is also possible to be unaware and distracted to the extent of not having to worry about even having any sort of ambition.

The consequence is that we also sacrifice our passion and desire in the process. These kinds of people end up becoming creatures of circumstance, rather than creators of circumstance.

This means having a limited ability to control your own emotions and the events that happen in your life. It is to adopt a victim mindset.

People with ambition on the other hand, have a lot more freedom and liberty in their lives. Ambitious people are completely limitless and unbound by what they can hope to experience and achieve, limited only by what they can physically and mentally commit to on a daily basis.

While this ambition has the power to liberate and propel us towards our dreams and visions, the effectiveness of our ambition relies entirely on how we enhance and embrace it.

In addition, we crucially forget that ambition is much more than simply achieving success in our aims and goals. A larger and often subconsciously neglected aspect of our ambition which is equally as important, is in the notion of feeling successful with our goals, not just in achieving them.

Many of us achieve amazing things in our lives and yet we feel entirely distraught and worthless. What is it that we are doing wrong?


### The cycle of depression.


Perhaps it is in the way in which we pursue the interpretations of our ambition.

In more simple terms, we can either take a pessimistic or an optimistic attitude towards our ambition and life goals and we usually shift between these states of mind on a constant basis, which is why our depression can be observed as a repeatable cycle.

Naturally we all have different cycles.

Some of us remain depressed for long periods of time while being only stable temporarily; others suffering an episode of depression once a week - it simply come down to our experience and understanding of life.

Thankfully it is possible to take control of these cycles. Part of why these cycle exists is the ineffective management of our depression.

For example, once we experience a level of stability, we can become arrogant with our mental health and lose our perspective of our depression by obliviously repeating the same behaviours time and time again, eventually falling back into the same instability we thought we were immune to.

This is why acceptance and humility is so fundamental to not only understanding our depression, but in order to come to terms with our emotional fluctuations.

These fluctuations can be caused by a variety of different things.

It could be from a break in our focus, perhaps from the sheer amount of ambition that we have in our lives, or even simply from our own impressionability to new and different ideas.

Learning not to take these fluctuations personally is one of the steps that we can take so that if we do fall into depression, can just as easily jump back into stability.

The problem with depression and staying in a pessimistic point of view where our instability creates this sense of perceived failure, is that it begins to form the core of our experience. This slowly begins to reflect in our beliefs and with enough of this perceived failure, can begin to erode and seep into our attitude and life point of view.


### Maintaining attitudes.


If you are reading this website then chances are you have some sort of ambition in your life. Furthermore you are aware of your ambition: You want to master and understand your own depression.

Often it is not that people lack ambition in their lives, but rather that they fail to admit they have a problem pursing their own ambition, perhaps even giving up all pursuit entirely.

For those who are self-aware enough to acknowledge their desire for ambition, maintaining a positive and optimistic attitude is fundamental to not only our success in life, but in our feeling of self-worth as well.

While aspects such as technique and process are important, our attitude is what drives ourselves to not only seek achievement, but clarity as well.

People with depression often think that their own ambition is a negative thing.

They take the belief that intelligence and ambition is somehow a burden to our lives and that it would be much simpler if we could just be emotionless zombies with no desire for anything greater than our own confirmity.

The unfortunate fact of life is that ambition is necessary for our survival, so neglect this ambition can only cause us more emotional suffering and difficulty, rather than liberate us from our emotions completely.

Ambition is a worthy blessing for any human being, but only if we take the time to embrace who we are, along with the dreams and visions that we keep in our mind.

Otherwise our struggle will always remain simple, though always a struggle none-the-less.
