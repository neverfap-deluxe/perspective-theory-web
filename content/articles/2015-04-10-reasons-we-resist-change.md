We are all resistant to change in some respect.

While we are usually resistant in our general tastes and preferences, like with music or politics, we also tend to be the most resistant when we need to change the most.

Resistance is like a sort of friction which aims to prevent us from making the wrong decision. The issues is that a lot of resistance is due not to certainty, but because we are uncertainty about who we should be.

In fact, we willingly hold on prior stigmas, harmful stigmas that cause us suffering, simply because we feel logically and emotionally familiar in the struggle that they provide.

Even though we may feel nervous or anxious on a regularly, we find it much easier to take comfort in the fact that we are still relatively safe, even though we are suffering.

We allow our limitations to define us and guide us in life, as a way of protection, though never as a way of true empowerment.

We resist change not only because we do not know, but because we do not want to know. We accept pain as a certainty, yet the idea of being free terrifies us.

When we become comfortable within these beliefs, we no longer need to consider alternatives. We think to ourselves: What if there is more fear? What if there is more pain beyond what we are currently experiencing?

More often than not we simply feel lethargic to change. We feel so down about ourselves that change is not even a notion that appears within our own mind.

In order to overcome these resistances, we need to begin questioning the way we think and feel. We need to start creating the desire within us to change, even if we do not feel or believe in ourselves to achieve it.


### Identifying limiting beliefs.


Firstly, it begs to note that change is always possible in our lives and sometimes it just takes a little inspiration to realise what we are truly capable of.

It could be that we have poor role models or that we have always perceived ourselves as failures or as worthless and so these mindsets have entrenched themselves into us. Our limiting beliefs latch onto us and they infinitely slow us down.

One of the hardest things to grasp when we are in a bad attitude, is embracing and appreciating this idea that change is possible, in trusting that the consequences of our actions are meaningful, but that they simply take time to have an effect on us.

We become awfully shortsighted when we are depressed and anxious, however doing small things like eating healthily and refraining from negative thoughts, literally make a world of difference in the future.

This is why understanding the context behind our depression can help us make the right decisions and overcome our limiting beliefs as to why we cannot change or why change may seem pointless.

Simply by understanding that our bad moods derive from our limiting beliefs, already dismantles a large part of the force holding our negativity in place. Once we realise that we have the ability to change these beliefs, it becomes a lot easier to navigate within who we are.

Our lives are very rarely static and we are constantly changing without knowing it. Often what tips us over the edge is when we try to change too much.


### Too much of a good thing.


Once we learn to regain confidence within ourselves, we can easily get into the habit of trying to over-improve ourselves.

We realise a certain level of stability in our lives and we try to improve on what is already working. In our infinite wisdom, we either return to dangerous habits of the past thinking that we are wiser and less vulnerable this time around or we take our curiosity into dangerous places.

Living through these cycles can cause us to become jaded and simply think that we cannot be helped or that change is pointless.

By learning to always stick to the basics, we can always find what it is that we are doing wrong and stop making false assumptions about who we can and cannot be.

Are we eating healthily? Are we practicing mindful techniques? Are we being productive and ambitious with our time? Are we focusing on our passions and not our problems?

Perhaps the worst thing that we do is that once we clear and relax our mind, we begin returning to the images and identities of the past, treating them like guilty pleasures that we believe to be harmful.

We start romanticising things again and we refrain from thinking logically and in our best interest.

This becomes part of the cycle of depression, where we find stability and then as if it almost bores us, we tread a little back only to find that it is unbearable and we repeat the cycle again and again. By maintaining perspective of our depression, we can give ourselves space and appreciation for our own stability.

While some of our beliefs are easily malleable, many are simply a byproduct of prior emotional trauma and are completely irrational and become very rigid and hard as a result.

Part of the reason why we develop strong beliefs is not because we are so certain about what we are believing, but because they provide us with a sense of security in knowing our potential.

We bring ourselves down with fear and insecurity, well before anything else can get to us.

Unfortunately this way of thinking is easily exploited and can merely cause us to become less confident and less in touch with ourselves.


### Control is not difficult.


It helps to understand that while wisdom does not change, however our knowledge and context is constantly evolving to provide us wisdom in thought.

We are constantly changing on a daily basis, however in-spite of these develops, the facts of who we are will always remain. Until we truly discover and understand who we are, particular through the experiences of others, we can never learn to accept and embrace ourselves.

This means embracing our capacity to live without pain and suffering - putting trust in an idea which may seem so far and distant in our own minds.

Maintaining control itself is not difficult. We have all maintained some level of control in the past and arguably when you are in control, it is simply not something you think about.

You are free. You are peaceful. However it requires a different way of thinking and it’s a kind of acceptance that can take some getting used to.

We simply find control difficult to empathise with because it is foreign. Like learning a different language, it all seems like a jumble to us until we finally discover meaning in the flow of the syntax and the rules of the grammar.

On the contrary in our minds, we are lead to believe that a lack of control is more simple, simply because it is without. We don’t need to think or take responsibility and so idealistically in our minds, we see it as being stress-free.

Of course, the result is almost the exactly opposite, which is why it is a misconception that we need to change in our minds.

Control itself is not about discipline. Control is a subconscious understanding of ourselves, where we feel infinitely comfort with ourselves, rather than agitated and alone.

Much like how a faulty car with flat tires is not easier to drive than a functioning car, we find it easy to latch onto one-sided logic with no resemblance to reality.

Change does not have to be difficult. We merely have to take the time to understand ourselves and our mental illness, so that we can understand and empathise with our thoughts and feelings to feel comfortable with who we are, rather than in a constant state of friction and resistance.
