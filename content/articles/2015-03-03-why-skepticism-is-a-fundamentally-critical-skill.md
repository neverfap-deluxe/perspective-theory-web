Many of us are cynics disguised as skeptics.

If you take a look at Google's search engine statistics there is an alarming divergence between these two completely different mental attitudes.

The term skepticism is searched only 160,000 times per month, while the term cynicism is searched more than 2,200,000 times per month, more than 10 times the former.

Perhaps it is because we are told that it is healthier and more realistic to be cynical. It could be that we believe the world is harsh, bitter place. Of course, this is a purely subjective take on the world.

This is an inherently negative and inaccurate way of viewing the world. Nothing is inherently negative nor positive. These are merely labels that we prescribe to reflect our beliefs of the world.

As long as we use these labels we will never be able to be honest with ourselves and our emotions. We will continue to fall between unsustainable moments of euphoria and crippling depression.

While cynicism hopes paints the world with a black marker, optimism hope to paint the world with a white marker.

Skepticism on the other hand hopes to wipe away all the ink and leave the world with untouched so that we can see it with clarity and purpose.


### What is skepticism?


Skepticism is a very healthy combination of checks and balances. It is an effort to question the reality around you, both internally and externally.

It is simply a way for people to explore and experience who they are, while maintaining a strong contact with reality. It is about discovering truth and in that, understanding who we are in conjunction with our nature and biology.

Skepticism is about learning to love and embrace perspective.

Cynicism on the other hand is the inverse to what skepticism represents. Cynicism hopes to disprove nature, even before we’ve had a chance to look at the evidence. We simply qualify nature based upon an attitude, be it positive (optimism) or negative (cynicism).

Cynicism is an overwhelming negative attitude and hate towards life, with no exception or regard for perspective. It is a fixed illusion of being objective through our qualifications of the world.

What makes us confuse it with skepticism is that it is equally as analytical, so it creates the impression that we are coming up with logical and rational arguments. What we do not realise is that our logic is corrupted by the bias in our attitude.

This is partly what traps people into cynicism, the fact that people believe their cynicism is actually objective skepticism.

In this sense, cynicism is merely biased skepticism.


### Understanding attitudes.


Just because cynicism is biased does not necessarily mean that it is bad.

I see these attitudes, cynicism and optimism, as skillsets that are appropriate for different situations.

If you are feeling under pressure in a sales environment where you receive a lot of rejections, then an optimistic attitude is vastly superior to a cynical attitude. In higher management positions cynical attitudes can be much more suitable.

Skepticism as well is merely a middle ground for us to manage these attitudes when we need them most. However without a strong foundation for skepticism, it can be difficult to manage these attitudes.

Skepticism is what gives us clarity. It does not hope to disguise or deceive. Part of the reason why cynicism is easier in many respects, is because it offers objectivity over our circumstances by claiming negative points of view.

This is something that skepticism cannot do, as it merely aims to acknowledge our understanding, rather than qualify situations into bad/good boxes.


### Changing attitudes.


Part of the objectivity and certainty of cynicism is part of the reason why cynics take things more personally. I mean, if you truly believe that the world is a horrible place, then it really must be a horrible place. Our interpretations become concrete truths.

Cynics then attach themselves to this image of who they are in their minds to their attitude and in the process we completely neglect how we feel.

Anger or sadness become the standard and we see no way out of it, because this is simply reality and we feel like we cannot inherently change reality.

The wonderful is that we don’t have to change reality. We merely have to change our attitude towards reality.

While a true skeptic will commit to not making any judgements or assumptions, a cynic will consistently make judgements regardless of whether they are correct or not.


### Skepticism and awareness.


Negative attitudes drive negative thoughts. This is because our judgements do not need to be consistent with reality, only with the way we feel about reality.

If a person has a negative attitude towards life, then naturally every aspect of their lives will become subject to hate and confusion. It is a very definitive way to give up your personal power and lose control.

Unless if we become aware of how attitudes function and the ways in which they can trip us up, it can become difficult to avoid emotional suffering.

Through self-awareness we can discover skepticism as a middle ground to our attitude towards reality, so that we do not have to live with fear or emotional suffering.
