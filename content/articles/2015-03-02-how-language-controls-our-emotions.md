Language is so much more than mere words.

Language is one of the most important developments in the history of the human race. It is through the ideas and symbols in our head that we are to logically able to experience the world around us.

Without language we most certainly would not be able to describe our feelings, thoughts or emotions in any coherent way. Language is the foundation for which we form complex ideas.

It is the very basis for humanity.

Many of us are unaware of this and as a result we end up taking the use of language lightly. This directly affects the way we think, feel and even the types of beliefs we end up forming.

It is the reason people end up in a state of incessant self-criticism, where people cannot control the obsessive thoughts in their head and become increasingly judgmental and cynical towards the world.

We merely think that language is a consequence of our actions. In actual fact our language is an inherent driver of who we are and by taking language lightly, we forget how truly impressionable and benign we are as intelligent creatures.


### When we abuse language.


There’s this idea that language is trivial, that the words we consume and produce are mere fragments of information with no meaning or consequence.

Unfortunately our mind does not treat language in the same way. Our minds are incredibly receptive to the way we use language and this directly influences not only what we think, but how we think.

We take language very personally. By calling yourself a failure you effectively reinforce this pattern of thinking in your head. Furthermore it affects your attitude towards life, as well as all of the other thoughts going in your head.

From these thoughts we develop behaviours and habits, which eventually form into solid beliefs. Language makes part of the building blocks to construct who we are.

The issue is that once harmful thoughts become behaviours or habits, they can become so etched into our subconscious that we do not even realise we are doing it.

This is why it is important to pay attention the language that we use, whether we are inherently optimistic or pessimistic in our tone. What are the affirmations that we constantly tell ourselves on a daily basis? Which statements do we make on a regular basis?

The issue is that once harmful thoughts form into behaviours or habits, they can become so etched into our subconscious that we do not even realise we are doing it.


### Language and neutrality.


Language is simply a tool for communication.

There is really no such thing as honest or dishonest communication. It merely comes down to how you use language as a tool to express yourself.

If you use language without truly understanding the consequences of how you are using it, then naturally you will end up suffering emotionally and developing behaviours which may harm you and the people around you.

As a result I put a lot of thought into the language of this website. I always try to employ a neutral, logical tone so that the intentions in my writing cannot be confused.

This simply derives from the ideology of perspective itself, where logic itself is the basis for our problems and that this logic itself has no negative or positive qualities, simply that we misunderstand how to use it.

At the end of the day, we are all here to understand how the mind works and consequently, how this ties into our mental problems and dilemmas.


### Observing language.


I personally invite you to pay attention to the language you use every day. All you have to do is observe. Try and be more conscious of your behaviours. Take notice to the judgments you make to yourself. Are you more pessimistic or optimistic in the language you use?

What we are trying to learn is to have preference over our thoughts. It is about being selective with what we think and understanding that actions through our words can form into behaviours and beliefs.

This does not mean that we cannot be free. What we do not realise is that we actually have more freedom when we do not commit to a judgment because the alternative is to keep an open mind.

We are not free to choose what we want to think when mired in judgment and our obsessive thought patterns. It is about embracing the capacity for choice.

This is what gives us control.
