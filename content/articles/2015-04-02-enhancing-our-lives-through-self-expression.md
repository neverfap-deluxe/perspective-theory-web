We are all brimming with imagination.

Just because we may not necessarily be creative people conventionally, does not mean that we do not utilise the capacity to experience and understand other people’s creations and art on a daily basis.

We listen to music that touches us emotionally, we read books that captivate us our souls and we experience the heartbreak and euphoria of the characters we watch on TV.

Even simple things like a quote written hundreds of years can ago, can be enough to capture the way we feel and evoke within us a sense of understanding that we haven't quite been able to put into words.

Thankfully for the internet there is literally a world of media waiting to be explored, conveying the infinite amount of stories from the present to the past, all expressing our uniqueness and individuality.

People who have gone through our own individual struggle and much worse, providing us with wisdom and knowledge to draw upon.

Through their words and stories, there is much we can learn about our own personal struggles and how best to overcome them, as well as gain insight into who we are as people.

Sometimes all we need is a little inspiration and a right frame of mind to push us forward.


### The importance of expression.


Put simply: expression is who we are.

Everything we do is a reflection of our expression as people. Our thoughts, our communication, our beliefs, our actions, our experience - all are a byproduct of our ability to express and desire.

What makes expression unique from an individual point of view, is that everything we experience, even if it has been created or thought by others, is completely unique to us.

Everything our consciousness perceives is entirely ours and it is in this sense, that we are true creators of our world.

By embracing expression, not only that of our own, but including the expression of others, we can learn not only enhance to our lives, but give us purpose and meaning through the emotion, feeling and thought that we can provoke within ourselves.

Activities like dancing can evoke ourselves to feel energetic and alive. Even if we feel inherently lethargic in the moment, proceeding to dance can give us energy and make us feel things we did not feel before.

This really is to empathise the importance of sticking to the basics in terms of our recovery.

Perhaps there is this assumption that perspective or self-awareness is this inherent get-out-of-jail free card for our mental issues, however this is simply not true.

The purpose of things like self-awareness is to give us clarity and perspective in order to do things which are inherently conducive to our mental health and wellbeing. It provides us with the necessary context in order to live without difficulty or suffering.

With this in mind, one of the ways we tend to hinder our recovery is through expressing ourselves dishonestly in a way that does not express who we truly are.

Carl Jung once said that the foundation of all mental illness is the unwillingness to experience legitimate suffering and there are many different ways that we can hide, delude and simply run away from our problems and feelings.

Through self-awareness and perspective, we can actually address our problems in a healthy manner that empowers us and gives us the tools not to live in fear or insecurity.

By avoiding healthy and progressive solution, we simply limit our ability to accurately gauge who we are and where we need to be, which is why open expression and trust is imperative to our recovery.

By suppressing ourselves and our feelings, we merely confuse ourselves further by masking our true emotions and feelings. As a result we end up putting more trust into the false identities of who we think we are in our minds, rather than in our emotions, feelings and thoughts where our ability to express exists.


### How expression affects the way we feel.


There is always more than one way to express ourselves and large part of how we feel comes down to way we express ourselves.

We have such an infinite variety of expression, ranging from the plethora of mental and physical activities out there in the world today, that our ability to be inspired is almost limitless. Aesthetics, Photography, Soccer and the list goes on.

The best thing is that we, as well as others, are constantly discovering new forms of expression that best capture how we feel with the times.

With all this in mind, it is important that we avoid expressions which can affect us negatively or create delusion within our own minds. Having abuse hurled at us through a speaker phone while being strapped to a chair for 48 hours or physically destroying everything we see in sight, is naturally going to affect the way we feel about lives for the worse.

We often forget that we are a product of our own self-expression and worst of all, we sometimes believe that we are above self-expression like we are some kind of omnipotent gods.

Unfortunately we cannot beat nature.

For example, those living in fear and insecurity will naturally want to express themselves in ways that capture these feelings and on a more subconsciously level, reinforce these feelings as well. So to accommodate we become anti-social, dysfunctional and artists of sabotage and cynicism.

What makes dealing with depression so difficult in our own minds, is that because of short-sightedness we fail to maintain perspective over the effect of our own actions.

Eating healthily may not have immediate effects on the way we feel about ourselves, however in the long run it can make a world of difference about how we feel about ourselves.

This is why I try to explain the importance of sticking to the basics and placing trust in these strategies, to gives ourselves more of a chance in the future to change and overcome our depression.


### Overcoming limiting factors.


The hardest thing is always taking that first step.

We become so mired by doubt and fear that we confuse it for who we are and we allow the self-expression to eat away into our souls.

Even if we have noble goals in mind and we know that it is important to our future, without a grasp over our self-expression we cannot hope to truly change ourselves for the positive. We simply give into the misery instead.

We have all been there. It sucks, however small steps are more effective than none. In my experience, we simply need to overcome the cycle of depression a few times, to truly understand what we are capable and worthy of.

I want to encourage you to adopt new and positive creative outlets to try and change how you feel. No only that, by try and decipher the things that you do on a daily basis that may cause you to reinforce your feelings of depression.

Through self-awareness there is a world of hope for us to draw from. All it takes is a little work and effort and can live without suffering or pain.
