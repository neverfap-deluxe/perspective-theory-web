Self-acceptance is one of the most fundamental skills we can learn in our lives.

Instead of acceptance, perhaps a better term would be to acknowledge. Acceptance has a connotation of giving up and remaining passive to the world around you. However if we see acceptance as this way of actively working with nature, then it may seem less contrived.

Acceptance actually has less to do with being comfortable and content with who we are and more about accepting our responsibility to change as a person. It is acknowledging that the choice is our to change, by accepting our circumstances and our ability to move with nature.

As long as there is nature, there is mobility.

To a large extent, your mental illness and depression is a bitter struggle between your internal thoughts of reality and actual reality itself. When we are depressed it is because we are in a state of rejection of our circumstances, rather than being accepting.

I want to help explain why acceptance is so important, which can help us better take control of ourselves and our reality - in the hope that we can change it.


### When we reject reality.


We all have a very vague idea of what acceptance is.

As per our favourite friend Wikipedia: "Acceptance in human psychology is a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a negative or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest."

Perhaps the most important phrase in that definition is: "a person’s assent to the reality of the situation."

What acceptance truly hopes to achieve is adjust ourselves to what reality truly is, rather than how we perceive it in our mind. Much human emotional suffering is the result of discrepancy with have with reality in our minds.

Acceptance of reality goes beyond merely acknowledging our circumstances. It is also about learning to embrace who we are.

Some of us may say that it is difficult to embrace and accept difficult circumstances. What people do not realise is that this is part of the challenge of learning acceptance, rather than something which invalidates it.

Acceptance is just a tool and like most tools, can be used for good or bad. Acceptance is about learning to deal and do with what you currently have, rather than blindly wishing for more. The opposite of acceptance is rejection and rejection entails a refusal to be honest.


### Acceptance and responsibility.


It helps to think of acceptance as a fundamental stepping stone towards changing your reality. Through acceptance we can ground ourselves in reality and reveal it for what it is.

Put in other words: if you cannot accept your reality, then how can you hope to accurately move and change yourself within it? If you are not relative in your mind to where you actually stand, then hoping to get anywhere is likely to lead you entirely in the wrong direction.

By rejecting our reality, we can only hope to make it more difficult to change ourselves, because the underlying assumptions we will make will be incorrect. It is recipe for further emotional pain.

Acceptance is not an ultimatum; it’s an understanding, of who we are and who we are able to become.

Acceptance is a commitment to acknowledging. In the context of depression, it is about accepting that what you may know about yourself and your depression is potentially wrong. In a sense, acceptance is a fundamental facet of skepticism.


### Acceptance and our beliefs.


What if you accept that there is no hope for your mental illness? What if you accept that you cannot change?

We often use acceptance against what it truly means. Acceptance does not make any agreements or assumptions about reality. It is like an un-assumption of sorts. It hopes to un-assume what we know as humans - rather than give us power through knowledge.

Knowledge comes once we have accepted who we are.

We often feel desperate for answers when we're depressed. Of course, these answers are often elusive to knowledge. Sometimes we cannot truly know the reasons behind our reckless behaviour in the past or why a particular person passed away.

If we are to truly accept our depression, it also means that we cannot take our circumstances personally. It means not feeling guilt or shame over your depression. It means understanding that depression is a very fluid construct.

Acceptance is a form of neutrality, while responsibility is what allows us to mobilise.


### Embracing acceptance.


Acceptance allows us to simply slow down and think a little more about the responsibility we have as people to ourselves. There are small things we can do everyday to promote acceptance in our lives, such as refraining from making judgments or taking things personally.

Of course, this article merely describes the utilities of acceptance. It does not explain why you are avoiding reality in the first place nor does it hope to explain how to accept, something which is deserving of a separate article.

Precisely however, because these issues are not the point. They serve purpose in our lives because of our inability to accept, rather than because they truly will bring us meaning and fulfillment in life.

To accept reality is to say that the choice is yours. You accept that you are your own consciousness along with the power that entails. You accept that you may be happy. You accept the possibility for change in your life and the consequences of your own actions.

Acceptance is a state of peace in our mind, a state which can allow us to live life without emotional pain.
