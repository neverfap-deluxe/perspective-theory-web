As you may tell, I have decided to give this blog a rest.

The reason is because I am working on a more effective way to help those with mental illness.

While I appreciate the value of perspective in written long-form, I do not believe it is particularly suited for helping people overcome mental illness. It relies too heavily on theory, rather than practicality, which is part of the reason why I decided to stop writing for this blog.

While writing for this blog has taught me a tremendous amount about myself, I have instead developed a framework that I believe is more effective in helping us understand how mental illness functions.

It is effective because it allows us complete control over our thoughts, feelings and beliefs, in a way that is holistic and can be applied immediately to prevent depressive thoughts before they happen or even while they are happening.

Of course, do not be mistaken: a framework is in no way a substitute for hard work. It simply makes self-awareness, mindfulness and cognitive therapy incredibly accessible and easy to maintain – to a point that it encourages sustainable and lasting mental health.

On a more personal level, this framework has allowed me to deal with my trauma, my obsessive thoughts, as well as other more depressive aspects of my personality, without the guilt and self-doubt that is usually prevalent in our recovery.

This framework aims to make recovery a less exhausting experience: something which is a huge barrier for those seeking mental health. In this respect, long-form perspective is ineffective because it overcomplicates things and as a result, is too indirect in its approach.

No one wants to read a wall of text to put themselves out of their misery… nor should they have to. It can often be more exhausting than the depression itself.

More simply, it just doesn’t work.

To accommodate for the development of this framework, I have been obsessively studying computer science in the hopes of creating something amazing. I spend most my spare time studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, Python, Clojure, Haskell, as well as other associated web development technologies and frameworks.

One of the limitations with this website, especially on the WordPress platform, is that I have limited ability to manipulate the visual and creative aspects of this website.

In the future I hope to develop a short, interactive course that should give you everything you need to know about yourself and your mind within 30 minutes to an hour. I am still deciding the best approach to this, however I have a few mock ups in mind.

To those who read this blog, I hope it has been a source of help and pleasure for you. I apologise for the atrocious grammar and poor writing, though that is a sordid tale for another occasion.
