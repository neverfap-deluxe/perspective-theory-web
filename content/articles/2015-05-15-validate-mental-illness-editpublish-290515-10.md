There are a lot of different theories regarding mental illness.

Some say it exists purely as a logical discrepancy in our minds. Others say that it is an extension of the behaviours and habits we exhibit and reinforce on a daily basis.

There is even growing evidence that it could be the simple result of having a poor nutritional diet. It may very well be a collection of these things.

One of the issues with those struggling with mental illness is that they spend too much time trying to define their illness, rather than pursing the effort of overcome it.

It can be very easy to allow these opinions to shape the way we think about mental illness, however part of the issue is that defining ourselves severely overlooks our true potential of who we can become.

Potential is one of those wonderful words that people misunderstand. We assume that there is a set potential, when potential is a word without limit or expectation.

Certainly, we cannot understand our own potential unless if we exceed it, which defining our problem does not allow. When we buy into the opinions of what mental illness is, we effectively set expectations of what we are capable of rather than allowing ourselves to truly test these limits through wisdom and effort.

Just like with athletes breaking new world records never thought possible before, we too must test our own personal boundaries and break these definitions rather than set them in stone.


### Asking the right questions.


Knowledge is important and certainly we should be trying to do everything in our capacity to understand how mental illness functions.

One of the biggest issues with those suffering from mental illness is that we tend to seek knowledge that is concurrent with the way we think, rather observe knowledge objectively as it is.

When we have a cynical point of view of the world we tend to be draw to other cynical points of view and so naturally we ask the questions in line with this cynicism, rather from the point of view of what is important to help us overcome our mental illness.

Asking the right questions is fundamental to finding solutions that are conducive to our mental health, rather than the questions which solidify the ideals we currently feel strongly about.

Furthermore, we are not acting with skepticism if we are not exploring alternative ideas to their fullest.

One of the biggest pitfalls of those with depression is that they assume their cynicism is actually a form critical thinking, which merely deludes us into taking appreciation to our mental illness.

One question I like to ask myself is which I believe is conducive to my mental health is: "How important is my own mental health and what am I willing to do to make it work?"

When we have focus and clarity in the principles of what we want to achieve, it can help us think in terms of the solution rather than the limitation we create for ourselves.


### The fallacy of cynical mindsets.


If we are ever to reach any sort of clarity then it can help to understand why cynical attitudes (or even excessively optimistic attitudes) are not objective in terms of aiding our mental illness.

Perhaps it helps to understand that committing to any kind cynicism or optimism actually takes away from our ability to think clearly.

This is because commitment only gives us power within a narrow range of understanding which makes us feel more powerful as people, however from the point of view of all ideas it actually makes us more vulnerable and less effective to the truth - what is ultimately important for our mental health.

Instead we need to start viewing our beliefs, attitudes and mindsets more as guides which explain how we should live our lives, rather than intuitive gods that know everything.

With this in mind, some beliefs can be helpful in creating the kind of perspective which aids to function in our own lives. It merely depends on the kinds of perspective their provide.

As cynicism is a form of belief, sometimes we can simply become so cynical that we refuse to see or understand the world from any other point of view and this is exactly why our beliefs actually take away power from our ability to reason and think critically.


### Making sense of what to believe.


One place we can start is to simply assume that everything we know about ourselves and our mental health may be entirely incorrect.

After all, if you truly are in control of yourself and the truth then why would you be mentally ill at all?

This kind can of questioning can be particularly helpful because it can help open our mind and see the world from a different angle, especially in terms of discovering solutions.

By opening up our mind we can discover the thousands upon thousands of opinions out there which can give us a greater perspective of life itself and break down the structure of beliefs which control our life.

It will also allow us to become more fluid and comfortable within a world that has an infinite number of answers to an infinite number of questions.

If we can understand how we simply attach to the opinions of others that most reflect on the way we think and feel, then it can create a level of skepticism to help us become more free.

Naturally this is can be very painful for some people as we tend to attach our self-worth and feelings to our beliefs.

To admit that the basis of our thoughts and feelings are incorrect is a very difficult process, especially for those who are particularly opinionated.

However as stated before, letting go of our opinions actually opens up our ability to think more critically and to be more understanding of the truth which is ultimately the goal of having these opinions and definitions in the first place.

The beautiful thing about perspective and self-awareness is that it does not discriminate against anyone and in many ways, it exposes the kind of irrational angry that it can cause in individuals.

This is to say that peace and calm is a natural state of mind and that for people to be so provoked by something, demonstrates a lack of mental health and control.

Perspective is helpful because it relies on understanding who we are, rather than forcing labels onto us of what we should be.

It is merely a description of who we are rather than a belief of who we should be. It is a neutral way of looking at the world, if that is what we believe our principles of ourselves should be.
