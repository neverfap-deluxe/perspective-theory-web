Emotions give life to the world around us.

Emotions are what give our consciousness brevity and depth. Emotions give us the impression of being completely unique with who we are. When we feel happiness, we feel it is our own sense or personality of happiness.

In the process however we entirely forget that emotions themselves are actually common and predictable. Humans find it difficult to empathise with other people’s emotions.

When someone experiences pain or pleasure, we can only relate back to our own prior experiences with these emotions. This completely changes their meaning of what these emotions truly represent, because without proper context we cannot expect to truly understand another person’s point of view.

In this sense empathy often requires a great deal of trust and faith, something which we can find difficult to commit to.

This can sometimes extend from our inability to trust and empathise with ourselves.

This is to say that we all come to the same emotions through entirely different means and understandings. What causes happiness in one person may cause sadness in another.

This is because we turn to our emotions to give life meaning and feeling, not to our circumstances. As a result we try and make sense of our emotions, when it really it is our circumstances that are more important for us to understand.


### When our emotions get the better of us.


There are several consequences of our dysfunction.

We may end up experiencing an excess of emotion or deficiency of emotion. One moment feeling lonely and non-existent, persistent with euphoria and agitation the next - cause of stress and anxiety.

While it is important is to acknowledge that our feelings are important on some level, this is not to say that our emotions are the cause or even the focus of our dysfunction.

In other words our emotions are not completely indicative of our circumstances, though they are still indicative.

Emotions exist to make our world feel real, however they are somewhat dissonant with the world itself.

When we pay too much attention to our emotions, we end up disassociating from ourselves from our purpose and from the true cause of our dysfunction - misunderstand circumstance and bad logic.

We end up doing things that we regret as a way of compensating for emotional fluctuation. We take drugs or binge eat to compensate with our emotional state, taking no consideration of our true circumstance or purpose in life.

Even if we know the consequences of our own actions, we become so caught up in our emotions that we become desperate for any sort of alleviation from our suffering.


### When we attempt to manage our emotions.


Our emotions can be managed to a point, though it is always a downhill battle compared to self-awareness and taking the time to understand our circumstances and logical mind.

When we try to manage our emotions through emotional binging, judgment drugs or even virtual reality, we can reach a point of delusion where the outside world becomes irrelevant in our minds.

As you can imagine this causes a lot of problems into the long term.

Even if we only rely on emotional compensation once every week, it is still a deviation from our capacity. It is not a true reflection of freedom and purpose.

While it is possible to be happy with ourselves with who we are without modification, part of what gives us hope is how we perceive the future.

Not everyone has the opportunity to dedicate their life to spiritual solitude, however learning to embrace the future and by viewing life as an opportunity to grow, we can achieve all the same effects.

If we are to overcome our depression or our dysfunction, then we must embrace this process - the growth and opportunity of understanding who you are and how we function.


### When our emotions are useful.


Our emotions are useful from the point of view that they are communicative.

When we experience pain, our body tries to communicate this to us so that we can get our of pain’s way. We we experience happiness it is indicative of the circumstance we are in.

It is as if our emotions are the precursor for all the attitudes and knowledge that we seek in life.

Like anything however, we must be skeptical and think critically about our emotions and how we associate with them. Our minds are not perfect and by thinking critically, we can address a lot of the bad logic that we have created over the years.

The false assumptions we make in our bad logic may seem innocent at first, however in the long run they can form into destructive behaviours and habits that can be difficult to change.

It could be in our irrational fears or our excessive judgmental behaviours. We may become aggressive or reluctant.

However the behaviours themselves are not necessarily the problem. The real issue in creating these behaviours we have difficulty changing them because of how we learn to create them in the first place through… which we do not yet know.


### Steps towards understanding.


The first step is to not take our emotions personally. By understanding that emotions make reality feel real, rather than exist as a true reflection of reality, we can take steps towards understanding our own behaviour.

The hardest part is trying to change our emotions while we are having an episode. This is why it’s best to always calm down first, which unfortunately most of us achieve either through exhaustion or sleep until the next day.

There are many different techniques that we can use to snap ourselves out of an emotional state. This website merely aims to provide the context though it is something I hope to provide in future articles.

By learning to become self-aware we can find ways to become differentiate from our emotions and have control over our behaviours.
