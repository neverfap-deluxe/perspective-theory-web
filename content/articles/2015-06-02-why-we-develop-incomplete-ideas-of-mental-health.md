Some of us have incomplete ideas about what positive mental health should be.

This is natural considering part of the reason why we are mentally ill in the first place is because we have not quite figured it all out.

One very prominent idea is that efficient mental health should primarily be about prevention as a way of addressing our depression and sadness.

The problem with this kind of thinking is that it only focuses on addressing the symptoms of our mental illness, rather than addressing how to live our lives.

Our mental illness is difficult and confusing because it is like trying to learn two completely different skills at once: overcoming the emotional pain and negative thoughts (the symptoms) and learning how to be productive and create meaning in our lives (the cause.)

To suggest that overcoming our sadness is the primary goal of our recovery is to assume that sadness is the only factor of our depression. This can be a one-sided understanding which traps us within cycles of depression.

Of course this is all entirely understandable, as excessive emotional suffering can lead us to a state of desperation and confusion which can hinder the ability to truly understand ourselves.


### Why we focus on prevention.


After a long period of time we can think that our mental illness is merely inherent and that quick fixes towards addressing our sadness, such as addiction or obsession, are our only alternatives of dealing with our problems.

In reality our depression has as much to do with our potential to be happy as it does with our potential to be sad. This is why it is important to understand the different ways with which we can promote both.

The primary reason why we tend to focus on our sadness is because of the inherently pessimistic points of view which we have developed along with our depression. We can assume that we are deserving of sadness and depression, and that prevention is all which we are capable of. In other words, we believe that we do not deserve to be happy.

It is because of these expectations that we remain within our depression and confine ourselves to a limited and narrow view of life.

We prevent ourselves from truly recovering, and we instead discover a world of destructive and petty ways to dull or distract our emotions rather than find ways to promote happiness in our lives. This is why ambition is so incredibly important in giving us hope and the ability to overcome our depression.

From an even more holistic point of view, our mental health relates to every single process which we attempt everyday and so focusing on these things can be a good place to start.


### An analogy for our mental health.


You can almost compare the brain to a vehicle which allows us to travel to different places and accomplish different things in our lives. It can be as simple as driving to the shops or going on a grand adventure around the world - this vehicle gives us the capacity to live our lives.

If this vehicle is broken or configured incorrectly, then we are limited in our capacity to carry out these tasks. If our tires are flat then we may be limited as to how fast we can go or where we can travel to.

Naturally, we want to try and fix this vehicle so that we can prevent this sorts of limitations.

If we use temporary, superficial fixes such as inflating our tires while not fixing the holes then we fail to truly address the cause of our problems, only the symptoms which we perceive to be the issue.

If we continually fail with these temporary fixes we can naturally assume that we are merely broken by design, and believe there is very little we can do.


### Overcoming our limiting beliefs.


What is interesting is that these are challenges that literally everyone goes through.

Everyone has limiting beliefs and insecurities of who they are. The reason is because they are not inherent, but because we find it incredibly easy to create them out of thin air. None of us are particularly unique in creating these limiting points of view, it is merely a result of our inability or inexperience dealing with mental illness.

This is why learning to overcome our mental illness is such a valuable skill because mental illness is something which can arise at any moment and at any age. It is about having the understanding to overcome all our challenges in life without difficulty, and it is certainly not limited to our own sadness or depression.

It can also help to understand that proper mental health is not a privilege in life.

While some people may not be mentally ill, at least traditionally speaking, it can also be the case that they have low expectations of life which some may consider a form of mental illness within itself.

On the contrary, people can have mental illness because their expectations are too high and yet have not realised it.

Through self-awareness and perspective we can better come to terms with ourselves and how best to live our lives.
