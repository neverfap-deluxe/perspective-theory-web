We all have moments where we feel like giving up.

We stop pursing all the logic in our minds for the heavy emotions our hearts. We stop pursing all the things we used to stand for that once had meaning and pleasure. We stop living healthily. We stop caring about what the future holds for us, even if it is a temporary feeling and we wallow in the present like flies without wings.

There is an immediate shift in expectation once we lose hope. Our previous desire fades into obscurity, as if it were all a big waste of time. The belief we once had in ourselves disappears and the fabric of trust which once drove us to exceed now appears as a great big lie in the sky.

"How could I be so dumb and stupid?"

We feel like cutting ourselves off from the world. We feel used and cheated. We feel distant from our objectives, when only moments ago we felt so close. We can barely remember when we last cared.

We feel useless and pointless. We find no point in trying, because we feel that we are unable to change our lives. It is like we have this great big hole inside us. An emptiness that needs to be filled.


### The way we associate our self-worth with our goals.


One of the integral reasons why we feel this way about ourselves once we lose all hope, is because of the self-worth we place onto ourselves through our goals and dreams.

We make these goals and aspirations our life. We put so much emphasis and effort into obtaining these goals, that we make them more important than our emotional well-being. In fact, it becomes our emotional fulfillment.

So when we fail these goals, it feels as if we fail and lose a part of ourselves. It is the same with people who put all their focus and self-worth into their partners or hobbies. If anything ever happens, if our partner leaves us or if one day we wake up unable to pursue our hobbies, it manages to completely devastate us and leaves us in a lot of emotional pain.

This isn't something to feel bad about. It is simply a reflection of your drive and motivation, that you are not willing to take no for an answer. It is a very noble mindset, however it is also a very inflexible one as well.


### Filling the void of our tattered self-worth.


Yet even if we accept that all hope is lost, this still doesn't remove our desire to feel a sense of self-worth. We still have the need to feel loved and cherished, even if it exists remains superficial unlike our goals.

We binge eat, smoke cigarettes, masturbate to pornography - anything to elevate our emotions long enough to keep us sane. We become desperate and seek quick fixes, in the hope that they might just be enough to lift us over that unbearable fence.

Part of the reason why we lose hope isn't necessarily because our circumstances have changed, but because we become cocky and arrogant about who we are and where we think we are going.

We believe we are more capable than we truly are and that we have no worries or potential fears over the horizon, which is an attitude that sets us up for failure when don't go our own way. It is failure to accept our circumstances and our humility as humans and is the natural result of endured success.


### How we get back on our feet.


For a lot of us our feelings can become so overwhelming that we have no other option other than to fall. We destroy ourselves for hours or even weeks at a time, before we finally come to our senses and regain the integrity we lost in ourselves.

Calming ourselves down should be our number one priority when we have these sorts of episodes. There are many different ways of doing this, very little of these will be non-destructive.

In the overall scheme of things, what is truly required to reunite us with our purpose is a shift in our point of view. Of course, this is difficult for us once we've lost all hope, because perspective isn't something that can provide a quick fix once we've allowed ourselves to get this far.

The issue here is purely structural. If we become arrogant in our projections because of the self-worth we place in our goals as a means of motivating us and making us feel good, then we're bound to trip ourselves up every time.
