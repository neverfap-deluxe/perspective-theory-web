Delusion can have a lot of meanings. Most commonly, we associate delusion with a form of denial about ourselves or of our world.

It could be that we choose to deny certain facts of our existence (perhaps prior trauma that we have not yet come to terms with) or unintentional denial through ignorance.

At its core, delusion represents an exaggerated and distorted sense of ego; a distortion of the image or idea that we have of ourselves and others. Images or identities can become distorted if they do not reflect the capacity of nature.

While this is not to discredit our own reality, to simply claim that reality is a purely individual and subjective subset of nature is incorrect. When we are disillusioned it is because we believe strongly in our own agenda rather than of our own true capacity.

It is in this sense, humans are largely disillusioned creatures, especially considering the amount of deception that occurs on a daily basis. While delusion cannot be helped, to merely say that delusion is not optimal for the long term stability of our function is also incorrect.

Of course, those stuck in a state of mind of delusion are none-the-wiser to their own condition, which is why perspective and self-awareness can be vital tools for us to uncover our delusions and address them appropriately.


### What does it mean to be aware?


Delusions exist primarily if we remain unaware of them.

We can have a lot of negative behaviours and habits that we are simply unaware of, yet perpetrate on a daily basis. Unfortunately, awareness is a very vague term that many people misinterpret and abuse, especially those stuck in delusion.

Many delusional people claim to be self-aware only because they truly believe their delusion is honest truth. So let us break awareness down so that we can better understand what makes a person aware.

At foremost, awareness needs to be conscious. This means that we need to have a completely open mind that is observing, rather than critically depicting or judging. Having a non-critical, open-mind demonstrates a capacity to control our thoughts and emotions and have focus in these areas, rather than someone who unconsciously reacts to their circumstances.

If we have a closed mind that is narrow, it means that we are incredibly easily directed and controlled, because of the way our thoughts are not congruent with the basis of nature. For example, if something which we feel strongly about, such as if abortion is brought up in conversation, it can evoke us to respond either vocally or emotively out of rage or anger.

What this means is that we can become easily offended or traumatised by certain notions, as a facet of not seeing things for what they are. Instead of accepting something as an opinion, the agenda in our mind activates and we react.

While there is nothing wrong with having strong opinions, I am merely trying to demonstrate that reacting subconsciously can lead very readily to delusion, demonstrating a lack of control that we have within ourselves. One misconception of self-awareness is that it is merely about ‘knowing’ and being aware of our circumstances.

This is not true, as many of us know about our issues and yet subsequently feel helpless about them.

Instead, awareness is about having perspective over our issues with a wide range of different perspectives, particularly perspectives that we may not personally agree with. This is because awareness is about having a holistic view of our situation, rather than what we personally believe so heavily in.

It is a process by which we come to terms with and accept our trauma through different points of views.

This is why this website is about perspective and self-awareness. Perspective helps us realign our thoughts and beliefs, while awareness is the practice coming to understand acceptance itself.


### How we exaggerate reality through denial.


Truth is a highly subjective idea because it is not dependent on fact, but instead on point of view.

What this means is that we can have completely different qualities of truth in life. We can have honest truth, dishonest truth. The interesting thing is that our truth is generally dependent on the kinds of narratives that we play in our mind.

If our narratives are exaggerated and distorted, then that will also reflect on the kind of truth we adopt. This is to say that our truth is a reflection of the way we view and see the world, rather than of the world itself.

Many of us simply leave our sense of truth to preference which is why many people remain in a state of depression for the rest of their lives, claiming it something they truly want.

Personally speaking I believe that no one wants to suffer and most people suffer by design. (i.e. thinking that they are deserving of guilt because of the toxic people in their lives) rather than out of intention.

Furthermore we uphold these institutions of suffering through the self-defeating limitations and barriers that we create for ourselves.


### Overcoming delusion.


The good news is that delusion is not uncommon and that we most likely experience delusion on a daily basis.

We have all been carried away by our emotions to some extent in the past and overcome trauma that we thought we would never be able to get over, such as speaking in front of the class when we were young.

Naturally, as time transgresses, we pick up and develop new and different points of view that change the way we feel about ourselves. Of course we can only allow these perspectives to help us dissolve our delusion if we do not reinforce our depressions through other self-defeating and negative perspectives.

There are a lot of different things we can do to dissolve our delusions of reality, predominantly through addressing the false assumptions in our beliefs, as well as through creating positive forms of self-esteem that empower us. Awareness is important to help uncover our beliefs which function subconsciously to our thoughts and certainly the road to recovery can be a long journey, though no longer that it should be necessary.

All it takes is the courage to question the way we think and desire a better outcome and it all starts with that first step.
