Through technology we distort the way we feel and perceive the world.

When you think about it, we now seem to experience reality with a bunch of screens which display information that contain everything we need to know about the world.

In the past, language was a fundamental development in which to convey ideas. Now the internet has transformed the way we consume information in any volume and capacity we want.

This essentially is transforming our humanity from a tangible view of reality, to a theoretical based reality.

We tend now to live our lives through ideas, rather than what they actually represent. We now read about the news that happens around the world, even though it’s usually so remote and removed from ourselves.

We have become a hyper-intellectual society, where ideas and knowledge is being embraced. In the process however, our emotions are being neglected and exaggerated.

Never has it been more important to pay attention to our emotions and the way we feel.

**The age of hyper emotions.**

Technology has a tendency to exaggerate our emotions through the way it conveys and projects ideas.

Ideas themselves are quite benign. The idea of two people having sex doesn’t really convey much in our minds. It’s something we may desire to a part of, however it does not form a solid picture in our minds.

However convey sex via videos in large, unlimited, quantities, varieties and access, and the idea becomes somewhat potent. Technology is the realm which allows this possibility.

There is a long documented history of addiction associated with the internet, all the way from gaming addition to pornography dependency. Many of us even develop OCD habits regarding the way we check social media.

Of course, aside from gaming and pornography there are now so many different ideas that can be conveyed by technology, it is as if there is unlimited stimulation in the world.

The unfortunate result is that it can completely disconnect us from understanding our emotions.

No longer does the world and our lives become about how we feel, but rather how we can evoke these feeling within us, regardless of the consequence.

We end up losing responsibility over ourselves, and we end up becoming dependant on technology for our basic function rather than focusing on the true cause: emotional fulfilment.

In the end we become attached to technology far beyond their utility. It becomes our sense of reality.

**Technology as a form of compensation.**

This was not so much an issue during simpler times.

We weren’t so overwhelmed by society, because it functioned locally without the excess of ideas. We thought in terms of function, like planning for the weekend, rather than completing another level in an online realm.

We were not so easily distracted. Technology was not there to help us, so we learned to help ourselves. It was a time where responsibility dictated your actions, not our desire to utilise technology to enhance things that ultimately do not matter.

Because of all these ideas, it can now even feel like there are so many different potential causes of the emotions in our lives. In reality however, all our core basic emotional requirements has stayed relatively the same.

We still desire to be loved. We still desire to care for others and ultimately technology can help you to do these things - however they cannot provide these things.

**Living with technology.**

The only difference with technology in our lives today it that we have now discovered one million and one ways to do things.

Doing these things isn’t what gives our life significance, but rather what we do with them that counts.

Some of them will be bad. Some of them good. However, unless if we come to terms with our emotions, it will be difficult to truly find a way in which we can use technology to assist our lives, rather than become them.

Instead of letting technology take control of our lives, we need to take control of ourselves and the only way to do this is to understand who we are and how technology affects our emotions.

Learning to become self-aware of our emotions is a stepping stone which can help us understand ourselves.
