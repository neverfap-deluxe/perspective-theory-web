Many people maintain a very jaded view about their own potential to recover.

They believe that mental illness is an inherently unstable trait which can only be agitated, rather than truly changed for the better.

So much of our lives can be spent in a state of doubt and limiting attitudes, that we believe trying to change who we are can only result in exacerbating our problems, rather than alleviate them.

<!-- more -->

These are very self-centred points of view which fail to focus on the bigger picture of recovery and particularly relates to how we have come to define our own mental illness personally. As an extension of our mental illness we tend to develop victim mindsets that are predicated upon pity and self-branded hopelessness, rather than empowerment and discovery.

In some ways we find it almost empowering to admit that we are incapable of change, as if we have predetermined our potential as human beings.

While this kind of thinking can almost relieve us of stress, in many ways it actually agitates us further because deep down inside we feel like we deserve better. It is a trade off we create. Through our pity and despair, we feel entitled as if we are experts of our own misery, as if we already have all the answers.

It allows us to instantly discredit those who have personally overcome their mental illness and it is in this way it gives us power. However, it is inherently dishonest and it comes across in the guilt and shame that we feel about ourselves for not trying as much as could be to help ourselves.

It is at this point that we create a foundation for perpetrating our mental illness beyond the initial trauma itself.

Yet there is always hope, even if it is somewhat misguided in our lives. Perhaps not the hope to get better, however it exists in some form regarding our perspective.


### Why we never actually give up.


Hope can be subtle.

The fact we wake up each morning demonstrates hope. It is in the actions of our existence, in the rage or sadness that hope perpetrates and gives meaning to the effort that we expend.

We see and feel that everything we do is always a work in progress, even if we may be unconscious of what our purpose may be. Humans are creatures of survival and adaptability and it is something which happens subconsciously in the mind.

When we ‘give up’ on ourselves it is not that we have truly given up. It simply means that we have adopted a certain outlook or expectation of how we can influence the world.

This is most notable in how we relate our actions heavily from what we have experienced in the past.

Attempting to change our mental illness may have resulted in emotional pain in the past, or perhaps we have come to experience that nothing about ever changes no matter how hard we try.

Furthermore, we are also reinforced by what has worked or resulted from our actions.

If doing nothing has created less emotional pain than trying, then that is how we will program ourselves to respond. What defines us however is our ability to create initiative in our lives and respond to these challenges.

While there is a lot that we can actually do to start our recovery, we often leave our recovery to chance in the hope our knight in shining armour will come rescue us.


### In a lot of cases this is true.


We may randomly meet someone positive in our lives or perhaps we spur an event which eventually gives us hope and rescue. At the end of the day, as long as we can focus on this idea of hope and how there is meaning in all the effort we expend each day, that we can create a sense of gratitude in our own existence.

That is the way in which we understand trust.

Even though there may be hope in life, it is more important to understand the responsibility that we owe towards this hope. Without responsibility we cannot hope to take the initiative to change.

I think one of the major reasons why we lose hope and consequently responsibility, comes down to the trust that we have lost within ourselves to change. When our expectations of life have become lowered or tarnished, it can find it difficult to truly utilise hope in our lives.

Trust is vital because it is what holds all our thoughts, beliefs and emotions together. Without trust we cannot possibly hope to act nor work with these aspects of ourselves.

Without trust we feel as if we have lost ourselves.

Of course, this is only what we have come to experience, not actually a reflection of what we are truly capable of.

Our experiences in life are powerful because they mould the narrative or the story that we play of ourselves to convince us of our reality. Dramatic movies with big explosions and tragic narratives work because it makes us feel and think like the characters in the movie and we do the same in our own lives.

If we are feeling despair, we exaggerate the events and create drama as a way to add flare to our existence.

In many ways this is destructive because when we portray self-defeating attitudes or mindsets, we over exaggerate them in our minds and we build upon them through rumination and despair.


### Regaining trust in our attitude.


This really represents the hardest part of our recovery in many ways - building up the courage to challenge these narratives and assumptions in our mind. In a lot of cases our depression or mental illness can exhaust us and so we naturally snap out of it. In a lost of others cases we can truly feel trapped.

Yet here is the interesting part about how trust functions: when we lose hope in life it is not that we have actually lost our trust at all. Our trust has merely transferred from one perspective to another. Based on our experience in life, we now trust self-defeating perspectives rather than empowering ones.

It also helps to understand that it takes a lot of energy and determination to believe that we are hopeless. It is not something that happens naturally and is why we can snap out of depression once we feel exhausted by it.

When you think about it, in order for these narratives to be effective we have to constantly drill these ideas into our mind without question.

Many people unfortunate continue the self-criticism and rumination because exhaustion fails to stop them.

This can happen for a number of reasons, particularly because these behaviours become ritual and give us a sense of security. We would rather feel guilty and shameful knowing that we « deserved » it rather than question why we exhibit these behaviours.

Thankfully having this understanding of trust demonstrates that we are not helpless and there are very positive steps that we can make to get us back to emotional and logical stability.


### Rebuilding self-esteem from the bottom.


People who ruminate and self-criticise themselves during their depression almost become athletes at feel depressed. They constant push greater boundaries in terms of how much guilt and shame they can feel on a daily basis.

Yet imagine if we used this energy and focus to help us overcome our problems, rather than harm ourselves?

I’ve written a lot about how we can regain confidence and self-esteem on this website and there are some very practical things that we can do everyday to slowly bring us to think about our recovery as something achievable, rather than impossible.

The best thing that we can do is start small and break things down so that we can better understand them.

The basis of self-awareness and perspective comes down to how we can better understand our situation and when our problems seem so complex, it can be incredibly overwhelming to try and comprehend.

Breaking things down is always the first step of self-awareness and is a good place to start, while reading about the different perspectives of self-awareness can help us better understand ourselves.
