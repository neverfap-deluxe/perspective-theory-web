My hiatus is finally coming to an end and I intend to resume on my regular posting of articles.

I apologise for my time away, however in actual fact, I've still been working hard behind the scenes to try and make this website the best possible experience for everyone. Going through all my articles and rewriting them and interlinking them has been particularly draining and certainly a lesson I have gained from.

It's interesting to see how my views on mental illness have changed since those articles have been published and even going back to very old messages from my past, have confirmed that there is hope for the future no matter what we have endured.

<!-- more -->

I see so many people suffer unnecessarily (particularly myself) and yet very few individuals take the time to consider changing the way they think about themselves. Part of the reason is because they do not know how (or are blind to their own devices) and it is in this pursuit for change that motivates me to help people with perspective and knowledge.

Though in-spite of my optimism, I have fully accepted that these are powers well beyond my own ability and realm. People can only help themselves if they want it and unfortunately in our age of consumerism and choice, helplessness has become an integral institution for people to abuse and assume identity.

Regardless, I want to make help for those suffering from mental illness as accessible and easy to grasp as possible, so that we can hopefully put an end to the suffering which so many people endure on a daily basis.

The fact that you are on this website signifies that you have faith in your own ability to change and perhaps it is the greatest gift any person can have.

Sincerely,

Julius
