Recently I had discovered a new perspective in regards to my own mental illness.

Internal family issues had escalated to point of excessive guilt and insecurity about the way I felt about myself.

It was an interesting experience because while I was entirely aware of all my emotions and thought processes, I also felt entirely helpless to what I was feeling.

I felt as if my fear was genuine and that perspective and self-awareness was limited in providing any sort of immediate relief.

It was because of this realisation that I discovered the idea that recovery is not a solution within itself so much as it is an aid for change.

Sometimes in our desperation we can idolise recovery and self-awareness as this kind of god that can save us from our own misery, when instead they are merely all tools or utensils which can be futile in even the best of times.


### Why recovery is not everything.


What I discovered was that recovery was merely an effort which is designed to help us change our circumstances, rather than make us immune to suffering itself.

Our circumstances can be the cause of our emotional pain, and in a lot of of cases we can be truly powerless to change them.

It could be due to the emotionally toxic family members in our lives or maybe financial reasons have us trapped. Unfortunately it leaves us with no choice but to endure the pain.

Mental illness is potent because it gives us the impression that we are unable to change our circumstances, irregardless of whether we truly can or not.

In effect this means that a lot of people who can change their circumstances end up remained depressed and self-defeated when they actually have the opportunity for recovery.

Furthermore, in some cases it can be better to simply cope and adopt delusional points of view to deal with our unchangeable circumstances, at risk of violence and destitution.

Of course our mental illness naturally makes it difficult to distinguish what we are really capable of as human beings.

Often those who can change are those who are stuck in the past (traumatic breakup, car crash etc.) or feel trapped in a reality within their own mind that is not congruent with how things really are (self-criticism, perfectionism etc.)

So we have two camps of circumstance: those who have no ability to change their circumstance and those who merely think that they cannot change their circumstance. Our mental illness traps us in both cases.

The good news is that there are still viable strategies to help us both cope and change, particularly in the way that we view suffering in our own lives.


### How we perceive change.


While change itself is invariably difficult in all circumstances, that does not mean that it has to be entirely gut-wrenching.

Recovery is always a gradual process of self-discovery and by learning to change the way we perceive the small things in our lives, we can allow ourselves freedom to do more with what we have.

It can help to think of our perception in relation to the fight or flight principles whenever we perceive a threat.

If people perceive that they cannot change their circumstances they they can tend to develop coping points of view based in maintaining and cultivating their circumstances.

If a person believes that they can change on the other hand, then they can tend to develop recovering points of view which hope to change and accept our ability to act.

In essence this demonstrates the power of optimistic and pessimistic points of view and even if we feel we cannot change our circumstances, this does not mean that our optimism cannot be subtle.

Simply because we are unable to move out of hope away from our parents, does not mean that cannot eat healthily or look after ourselves.

Understandably we do all these things as a way to cope and validate our feelings and thoughts tied to our circumstances, however recovery is largely about adjusting ourselves towards reality, even if we feel beholden to the abuse and trauma of our lives.

This is why it is important to start small and learn discover ways to relax and develop focus in the control over our lives.

What is truly conflicting however is that both of these approaches, coping and recovering, are both as equally effective as each other in that they both help us deal with our pain.

Unlike recovery, to cope is to normalise and validate our pain by adjusting ourselves towards the point of view of our trauma, rather than from the point of view of reality.

The difference between delusion and a 'clearer' version of reality is that delusion needs to be maintained and of course the true beauty of delusion is that it tricks us into thinking that we are not maintaining it when we are.

While I have written about delusion in the past as an ineffective way of truly coming to terms with our mental illness, I also understand that some people simply do not have a choice.

Of course, part of the reason why you have come to this website is because you have accepted that you are not restricted by your circumstances and that is certainly something which self-awareness can provide.

Perspective and self-awareness are wonderful ideals and certainly they are more effective than most, however that does not mean that they can assist in everyoneâ€™s problems as I have experienced personally.


### The importance of critical thought.


It is in these cases that we must highlight the purpose of critical thought to help us come to terms with our mental illness.

Critical thought itself is only a tool which can help us rationalise our behaviour, however it is a good start to get us thinking about our problems.

If you are reading this website then chances are it is because you have personally recognised that you do have a capacity to change within your life.

While I believe that perspective and self-awareness can be amazing solution for those willing to learn, that is not to say that is ideal for everyone especially those currently still in abusive situations.

Perspective and self-awareness can however be a noble endeavour if you are trying to recuperate from past trauma.

Recovery should always be the end goal for overcoming our mental illness even if coping may seem easier and quite seriously, it is only something that you can decide for yourself.
