Sometimes our mental illness can feel more like a fight than a struggle.

It can be like kind of perpetual challenge where only one victor can remain standing, the war with our thoughts and emotions can feel like a one-sided battle where our mental illness always has the upper hand.

When we feel angry we try to push it away with even more anger. We force ourselves into the emotional lows with the impression that exhaustion in the only way out of our struggle.

We reason with our irrationality with the intention of taming it, only to feed it more power through our focus and attention. Our feelings and emotions are the last things we want to surrender to when we are least stable.

We fight ourselves endlessly, merely leaving ourselves worn out, vulnerable and distraught.

Instead, we can find peace in our lives by focusing on the cause of our mental illness and taking the time to understand it, rather than trying to directly fight our thoughts, feelings and beliefs.

This is why it is important to change our preconceptions of what mental illness is in order to approach our dilemmas from a constructive point of view, rather than something destructive which causes us to repeat the same mistakes and spiral back into states of anxiety or depression.


### Why we fight our feelings.


Some of us fight ourselves because of how we have conditioned ourselves in response to our depression and the people around us.

When we remain depressed for a long time, we can become irrational to the point of constant anger and frustration. This mindset causes us to always find ways to become angry or criticise, based on our experiences with the world and in our own mind.

We believe that if we do not fight we will somehow « lose » to our emotions and suffer even more.

It could be that we have experienced a state of engulfing sadness or complete apathy and helplessness in the past and that the only way we have discovered in the past to counter this, is to build up all this hype and negative energy inside of us.

This is why many people resort to exhausting themselves as a way of dealing with their irrational thoughts and emotions.

They become so mired in anger that it becomes a reinforcing cycle of self-criticism that it becomes subconscious and out of their control. Of course, what they do not realise is that exhaustion is not a form of coping.

It can be a very devious form of suffering.

Over time we automate this suffering and it merely becomes something that « we have always done » in our lives and so we don’t feel so much trapped, as we do naturally dysfunctional.

This is one of the ways in which we can exacerbate our mental illness and create misconception and dysfunction in our lives.


### Understanding limiting beliefs.


The way we trap ourselves into these mindsets is through the limiting beliefs that we have of ourselves and what we are capable of.

We simply assume that we are dysfunction because that is just the way we are and that it can never change. It is a self-defeating mindset disguised as truth.

Though how else should they know better?

Understandably it is difficult to change a rigid point of view that has been continually reinforced over an entire lifetime. That however, does not denote the responsibility for a person to change their own lives.

It is simply one of the many challenges that a person suffering from mental illness must face.

Thankfully perspective acts with a cumulative effect. Reading this article alone will most likely not change someone’s mind instantly about the way they feel, however after reading hundreds of these articles, it will begin to paint a clearer picture about the way our minds function.

So I encourage people to always try and address their limiting beliefs, with which there are many different ways and techniques outlined in this website.

One way of helping us address our limiting beliefs is through acceptance, rather than through the incessant fighting that goes on in our mind.


### The importance of acceptance.


Acceptance is the ideological opposite to fighting.

It is also one of the most important skills of perspective and self-awareness available to anyone suffering from mental illness.

I think one of the reason why acceptance gets a bad rap is because of the connotation that it has to people who are deeply cynical and depressed.

It is symbolic with loss. To accept who you are is to suggest that you accept your depression and your sadness. It is accept defeat and loss. There is no empathy with acceptance and as a result we choose to fight endlessly.

We fight for so long that we no longer even remember why we fought in the first place.

We build ourselves into such a state of paranoia and irrational fear that we cannot even momentarily stop to witness the silliness of the whole thing. We make up all sorts of opponents and reasons to fight in our mind, feeding back into the delusion of our feelings.

Acceptance is important for one very simple reason: There is no war. There is no opponent. It is all one big fabrication in your mind and you are your biggest enemy.

Chances are that we already know this. We know that we are trapped in fear and that we do not know how to stop.


### Embracing self-awareness.


This is okay and it is simply going to take baby steps to get us back to where we want. As long as we work towards self-awareness, there will always be hope and progress.

While acceptance is always the first step, there are small things that we can do everyday to help us slowly break from this cycle. Meditation can do wonders over time and simple gratitude exercises can demonstrate the power we have over our mind.

What usually helps the most however, is learning to become skeptical of ourselves and to constantly ask questions about the way we feel, think and behave by slowly becoming self-aware to our own behaviours and thoughts.

Often we feel lost because we cannot even identify who we are. This is why even writing down our emotions, thoughts and feelings can help us tremendously with becoming self-aware.

This website also contains a wide variety of perspective articles to help your journey. There is always help around the corner.
