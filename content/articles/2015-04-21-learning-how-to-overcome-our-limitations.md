We all create limitations in our lives for a variety of reasons.

We may be fearful of changing who we are or we may simply prescribe to the belief that we are incapable of any amount of change and that to pursue change would be a timely and painful waste of time.

These litmiations exist largely as a perceptions in our minds and as a result, we will find an infinite number of reasons to justify these perceptions through the way we think and feel as a way to protect ourselves from pain and suffering.

Unfortunately limitations do not discriminate between our emotions and feelings and so they also shield us from our own happiness and joy, as well as a wide range of empowering and desirable emotions.

This is because when we view life from the point of view of fear and protection, we fail to see the growth and opportunity that is also prevalent within our circumstances.

Furthermore, since many of these limitations are perceptions based upon the way we feel, a largely majority of them do not exist or only exist as irrational misconceptions we unintentionally use to sabotage our own well-being.

In order to change these perceived limitations we need to change our attitude and mindset towards life which can help assist us in changing our limiting beliefs.

This means we need to change the narrative that we play in our mind by adopting positive and empowering narratives which allow us to see opportunity in our lives.

In this process we can also keep the healthy limitations that we have not based in misconception (as a way to create focus in our lives) but also dissolve and expose the harmful limitations which have no place in our lives.


### Solidifying perceptions.


I wish to tell you a story from high school which shaped the perception of who I was.

One thing you may not know is that I used to be hopeless at English.

I could barely get through a book and even then, I had a very vague and linear understanding of literature. I could not write an essay for the life of me. I simply thought that I was incapable of ever doing well at English. I was always incredibly poor at English and that was just the way things were, no matter how many tutors or extra classes I took.

To further entrench this idea in my head, I had this very old and traditional English teacher who claimed that statistically speaking, there would always be a few of students who would be hopeless at English and remain hopeless for the rest of their lives.

I was so bad at English that when I wrote sentences, I would often confuse tenses and go back and forth between past, present and future tenses.

I felt hopeless, and I never dreamed of ever being good at English.

After high school however, I had a vision of becoming a journalist. I knew I was not very good at writing and English, however I had this vision in my mind of becoming a brilliant writer.

I would spend hours practicing my writing and hours reading books and online articles. Surely enough, the rest is history and I can now write and read with a kind of confidence that surpasses most. The importance of this story is that there were two distinct narratives going on in my head that change over time. A limiting narrative and an empowering narrative.

The limiting narrative was that I would always be terrible at English no matter what, however through my vision of becoming a journalist, I created an empowering narrative of who I wanted to become.

In other words, if we do not have a vision of who we are - an empowering narrative of who we want to become - then we cannot hope to overcome any sort of limiting narrative. It always starts with a dream and through this dream, we can begin to expose our perceived limitations.


### Changing our limiting narratives.


Narratives are the stories that we play in our mind which give power to our beliefs. Through our thoughts and feelings we give life to this narrative so that it appears real and convincing.

Changing our narrative is difficult in the beginning because naturally our thoughts and feelings are supporting a limiting narrative of who we are. This is something which we have to look beyond by not taking our emotions personally and highlighting the true purposes in our lives. This is where focus is important.

You may be thinking, what if I am already perfectly happy with the narrative in my head?

It is important to understand that we have more than one narrative going on in our minds. Some of them can equally empowering as they are self-defeating, even on the same topic at hand. A break up can make us feel equally angry as it can sad, it all depends on the narrative going on in our head at the time.

There are a number of ways with which we can change the narratives in our mind, either through dissecting the agreements and beliefs we have or simply to change the way we feel about ourselves. First however we must create an empowering narrative (or empowering vision) to guide us towards our purpose and goals. When we focus solely on the opportunity in our lives, limiting narratives often dissolve away without effort.

One way we can change our mindset to an empowering narrative is to build confidence and self-esteem through our actions.

Self-esteem is important because it serves as a stepping stone to prove that we are capable at doing things in life. By starting with small steps, we can slowly demonstrate more and more to ourselves, until we reach a point where we realise that hard work and ambition is more important than relying on our ego for self-worth. It is about cultivating our vision and working towards who we want to become, rather than validating who we think we are.

Through self-awareness and perspective, we can slowly changing our limiting beliefs and develop empowering beliefs towards our own life.
