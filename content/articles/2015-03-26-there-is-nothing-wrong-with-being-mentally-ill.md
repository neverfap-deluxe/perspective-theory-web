Mental illness is not an exclusive condition.

It is not like a virus which is completely foreign to our bodies. Mental illness is a capacity within all of us that is constantly fluctuating in size and influence.

Though I am very susceptible to mental illness, I am no less functional or ambitious. It simply means that I have some challenges to face with my own mental health.

Unfortunately a large majority of people in society are oblivious to their own mental illness.

Many people simply do not classify themselves as being mentally ill, even though they display behaviours of excessive judgment, have severe anger issues or even as partake in a wide range of destructive behaviours such as smoking and alcoholism.

This is because we only pay attention to the types of mental illness which are in-conducive to the kinds of societal norms which we consider productive - those which do not hinder our ability to work jobs effectively, regardless of the damage that they do to ourselves or the people around us.

As a result we end up respecting people’s quirks no matter how dysfunctional or unaware they are.

Consequentially we stigmatise, condemn and judge those who have mental illnesses which we consider unproductive, even though it is all part of the same predicament.

At the end of the day we all seek some form of stability and function in our lives irrespective of how aware or unaware we are of our own mental illness.

While being aware of our mental illness can seem like an unnecessary burden, especially if it goes against societal norms, I am writing this article today to say that there is nothing wrong with being aware of our mental illness.

In fact, being aware is a wholly positive and critical step towards understanding and successfully changing ourselves for the better.


### Changing attitudes towards mental illness.


There are no such things as problems in life.

The word 'problem' is an inherently pessimistic word and it is important to note that the types of attitudes that we adopt in life are imperative to understanding ourselves as human beings.

Everything we do comes down to attitude at the end of the day and everything has the capacity to either be a problem or challenge.

The reason we we should promote optimistic points of view is because they give us hope to overcome our challenges, rather than allow ourselves to be stuck with our "problems."

In this sense we have no choice but to view our mental illness from an optimistic point of view.

Otherwise we make it nearly impossible to move beyond our mental illness, particularly in line with our own goals and ambitions which is where hope and optimism lies. One common challenge that people face is in the social anxiety that they have in meeting new people. Certainly it was a challenge I once faced.

Arguably no one wants to be socially anxious and even though I actually enjoyed myself once I was out there, the initial idea of going out would prevent me from ever leaving my room.

If we treat our social anxiety as a challenge, rather than a problem, then there will always be the option to move on.


### Adopting hopeful attitudes.


Cynics and pessimists refuse to take on optimistic points of view because they believe it is an inherently dishonest way of viewing the world. In all our hatred and confusion, nothing seems to make sense and because of this, we feel like no amount of positivity in our lives is going to help us.

What cynics fail to see is the consequence of this positivity.

Dressing nice and smiling more is not going to instantly make people want to be your friend, however it will still make you more approachable and more likely to meet new people.

While optimism will not instantly change us it will give us the ability to change more easily, which is always better than not at all. We focus so deeply on our problems that we forget to focus on the solution, which is why pessimists usually drive themselves around in logical circles, exaggerating things and ruminating for not definable purpose.

Perhaps the biggest misconception of hope is that it is designed to make our "problems" seem less difficult and this entirely misses the point of what hope is about.

Hope is about focusing on our opportunities and making them seem a lot more accessible. The challenge is always about the solution, not about the problem.

In regards to social anxiety (as I have mentioned previously,) slowly we can change our limiting beliefs about meeting new people. We uncover our fears by exposing the faulty assumptions in our mind. From this we develop a true sense of confidence and soon we can learn to enjoy and embrace social situations.

A large part of mental illness is in feeling like we are incapable or worthless no matter how hard we try, which is a pessimistic point of view.

Funnily enough if we use this notion to embrace ourselves and to feel capable in-spite of the odds, we are essentially still describing the exact same thing, simply with a different attitude.

In both cases we are merely describing ambition - that deep desire to change, yet as you can see each instance is completely different in mindset and attitude.

Instead we need to use our attitude to propel us forward, not bring retrograde within us. It is good however it that it demonstrates that we have ambition, even if our actions may be harmful.


### Embracing our mental illness.


Any amount of mental illness is difficult in our lives.

It is an aspect of our personality that can allow to eat away at us and consume us. On contrary, it is an aspect of our personality that can empower us and push us forward.

Like anything else in life, it is simply a matter of how you embrace the circumstances that have been given to you, not only to reinterpret them but to change them as well.

I guess one of the unfortunate tragedies of being neurotypical or functionally stable all the time, is that there is no necessity to exceed or perform, which is why it is a lot easier to remain unaware.

If I do not change or have ambition by necessity, I simply remain dysfunctional and obviously this does me no favours.

Most of us share the same struggles, like earning an income or living with fulfillment, however our struggles are not the predominant cause of pain we experience in life.

We all experience pain, whether our loved ones pass away or from the criticism and judgment we experience on a daily basis, however it is only in our attitude that we perceive them as being more painful or difficult than they should be.

I believe the more challenges a person is given in life, the harder it pushes them to exceed and overcome them. Sometimes we perform better when we are not given a choice.

I used to hate the idea working. I saw it as something problematic to my dreams and goals in life, like an unnecessary evil that people are subjected to.

Now I am happily working full-time while writing articles whenever I have a spare moment. I even still have time to spend with my girlfriend and pursue my hobbies.

In-spite of our challenges we make it work and we do it with style.

There’s nothing wrong with being mentally ill. We are  all mentally ill and it would be a great shame to delude ourselves otherwise.

As long as we understand that mental illness is a description for individuals who do not function as per what society would expect, we no longer have to beat ourselves up for who we are.

You are not special, however you are also not hopeless. We are all capable no matter what and it something we should all hold dearly to our hearts.
