I want people to learn something new and fresh with each article.

I do not want to waste people’s time. I always try to have some kind of significant take away with each article and this often makes it difficult for me to construct article titles, because a few words cannot always capture the essence of a concept.

Even though I display a level of control over my life, I would still consider myself a person with a depressive personality. This does not mean that I am not mostly happy all the time, however it is a complex relationship that I still have with my personality.

What makes self-awareness so brilliant is that it allows me to constantly learn new things about my depression to the point that I have come to not only understand it, but appreciate it as well.

Part of this means no longer suffering from depression.

I still suffer from episodes of depression, usually once every two weeks however I have come to notice that they are less and less frequent. In the past I used to be depressed for months at a time, so it is a welcome improvement to say the least.

My depressive episodes almost fade within an instant now. The panic/anxiety hits me and holds me for a few hours at most and then it slowly releases itself into irrelevance. I feel okay again and life continues where I focus.

While self-awareness is shunned because it is not a quick fix or a pill that we can take to instantly feel better, it encompasses a solution that not only can help us manage our depression, but give us a form of long term hope where depression is no longer a thing.


### **Self-awareness and depression.**


The biggest issue that people have with depression is that they have no idea what depression actually is. Depression is this mystical taboo to them. It is the most intricate mystery in our minds and as a result, we come up with all sorts of theories and concepts to try and rationalise our feelings and behaviours.

We try and predetermine our depression and our outcome. Will I always be depressed for the rest of my life? Is medication the absolute best I can do? Will I ever have any control over my thoughts and emotions?

We end up qualifying ourselves based on our personality. While different attitudes and states of mind are more suitable for different situations (for example, optimism when working in sales and pessimism when working in management) our depression requires a more open and malleable state of mind.

Our ultimate goal here is to understand our depression and the only way to do this is personally observe our behaviours and take the time to understand why we function as we do, so we can not only manage our behaviours, but diminish their intensity.

Once we truly understand something it truly becomes less scary and it no longer remains confusing. When depression onsets we can know exactly why. We can know which emotions that we have triggered, including the trigger itself.

When we enter this observance point of view, where we are acknowledging our depression, it almost takes away from what we are doing. We no longer become in the story of our depression and this sort of skepticism is what dissociates ourselves from what we are feeling in the moment.

Depression is only effective if we believe and commit our focus to the "story" that we tell ourselves in our mind.


### **Depression and personality.**


How we treat and view our depression ultimately comes down to our attitude, which is why we need to change our attitude towards depression towards something workable. I know this may not make sense to you, however it is something that requires a level of faith to understand.

I used to have a very self-defeatist and cynical attitude towards my life (and hence my depression). I was eternally confused and hurt and I would spend months at a time in a horrible state of sadness.

In fact, each time I returned to depression as a resolution to my problems, I would continue to spend months at a time in a complete state of sadness. I never questioned it because I was merely following my preconceptions of what it was.

It was not until I decided to change my attitude towards depression and my life that things began to turn around. My depressive episodes became shorter and shorter. Now my depressive episodes last a few hours at most and I do not feel crippled with extreme guilt or shame.

If we ultimately want to become people who can understand and appreciate our depressions and not allow us to be dictated by our own terms, then we need to become curious and inquisitive people.

We need to be constantly questioning and trying new things and being critical of who we are, rather than commit ourselves to what we truly do not understand. This requires admitting that everything that you may know about depression and yourself is wrong.

It is a very hard thing for people to admit, however it also part of dissolving our ego and sense of self-importance. There is a method to everything.

If you are the kind of person who runs away from their problems, then your depression will be treated in the same way and it will end up like all of the other things that you have run away from in your life. If you are inherently cynical and full of hate, then your depression recovery will also reflect this.


### **The beauty in our outcomes.**


If we can observe our depressive states, we can learn what makes them tick. It is the first step to becoming self-aware.

In order for this observance to be effective, we must also take the time to learn the basics of self-awareness and the functioning of our mind. This means understanding our what emotions, thoughts, beliefs are. It means understanding how our judgments function and the consequence of such behaviours.

I have created this website as a complete solution for people suffering from depression. It not only covers all of the theory in regards to how our mind functions, however it aims to cover all of the techniques of self-awareness that we can use, in addition to the context and understanding required to bring it all together.
