Perspective and self-awareness are not perfect systems.

They can be highly effective for those looking to overcome their mental illness, however they are not always suitable depending on where we are at with our recovery.

Self-awareness and perspective are simply one of the many thousands of the solutions out there which is why it is important to think critically about our approach towards our own mental illness.

People have a habit of entrusting their problems onto others only to be confused as to why they do not seem to be getting better, even in the hands of psychological experts.

The simple fact is that we are the only ones who are truly capable of helping ourselves, as much as we all desire an easy way out of our mess.

There is this assumption that our memories and trauma from the past can disappear from our minds: like the wave of a wand, our problems can all go away.

While this is not true, this does not mean that we cannot live a life that is full of opportunity and love. It does not mean that we cannot be the best and most desirable version of ourselves. It simply means that we need to take control of ourselves and allow ourselves the time to better understand who we are and what we can do to change.

I advocate self-awareness and perspective for a whole number of reasons because I believe it is the most effective solution in regards to understanding and dealing with our mental illness.


### Why self-awareness may not be ideal.


Of all the systems available for our recovery self-awareness is arguably the most difficult, most challenging and most likely to go wrong.

For example, it is advised that people who are deeply cynical and only beginning their recovery to not immediately expose themselves to the ideas of optimism as it may hinder their progress and cause them to become even more cynical.

What makes perspective and self-awareness so troublesome is that it throws people into the deep end which can turn effectively turn them off pursing their effective means to address their mental illness and even relegate back to harmful behaviours.

Not only does self-awareness require you to question and challenge the core of your assumptions and beliefs, however it is requires a kind of courage that can shy people into guilt and shame for not trying.

While to some people the challenge and steep learning curve of self-awareness is a motivator, for a lot of people this can actually be terrifying. This is why it is important to start smart no matter what system we use, so we can get a better footing over ourselves.

This is to say that each system of recovery requires a large degree of trust and understanding within ourselves before we are willing to even consider or attempt them.

If we are already confused and fearful of ourselves, then radical ideas such as self-awareness seem almost absurd if not offensive. This is also why people often do not attempt to dismantle their mental illness until it is far too late.

Furthermore, our introspection of ourselves through self-awareness is a never-ending journey.

While we certainly end up reaching a level of clarity where our moods and thoughts become almost effortless, perspective is something which must be constantly maintained and at no point does it protect us from episodes of depression when they strike.

Perspective is simply a way of dealing with our depression by giving us a greater chance of preventing it from reoccurring and limiting it’s influence when it does strike. Ultimately perspective is something which we cultivate through time and experience, especially if our problems are complex and intricate.


### How we can abuse perspective.


In a sense perspective can be dangerous.

Dangerous in the sense how a gun can be used for murder, just as equally as it can be used to hunt for food.

I believe in the philosophy of individual empowerment as the most effective method of recovery, which is why I decided to create this website where people who are looking to actively help themselves.

Believe it or not, as much as perspective can be used to empower us, it can equally be used to give even more power to our depression.

Cynicism often breeds deeper cynicism and through perspective, we can simply complicate and enforce our mindsets unintentionally. This is why brute optimism does not work on those who are deeply cynical as I mentioned earlier.

As much as knowledge can be liberating, we can use it as a way to keep us more ignorance by avoiding certain behaviours and notions to remain unaware, rather than self-aware. While perspective may be an amazing tool for change, it also requires a level on initiative on behalf of the person utilising it.

What this all really means is that before we embark on any amount of change, we must fundamentally realise why it is we are pursuing recovery from our mental illness and we cannot do that without basis of awareness.

Through asking questions or even noticing odd discrepancies, we must become aware about some aspect of our personality before we can change.

It could be that we have noticed a pattern in our mood that has made us curious about our depression or even the idea that being depressed all the time does not quite sit right in our minds.

What we want to do is build upon this awareness and expand upon it by slowly exposing all the logical fallacies in our mind.


### Embracing perspective and self-awareness.


So with all this in mind, do you still think that perspective is right for you?

What I like about perspective and self-awareness the most is that it is an effective, non-discriminatory system which works with most, if not all types of mental illness.

Perspective and self-awareness does not aim to change us from the point of view of rejection or suggesting that we are even flawed. It is a system that provides us with a different outlook on life so that we can be effective while staying true to our goals and intentions at heart.

It is a very concise way of better learning to understand ourselves and change the way we think. It is a holistic system which everyone has something to benefit from.

In my own experiences, mental illness is not something that does not have to be permanent. It will require some work, however this is a subjective question you must ask yourself.
