I still suffer from depression.

The term depression however, is a rather misinformed way of trying to understand the meaning and relevance of mental illness.

In fact we have many different conflicting connotations of what depression is in our minds, which is one of the reasons why it keeps coming back to bite us.

<!-- more -->

No one is immune from depression, unlike a disease which can be permanently cured and forgotten. This means that while I still have my bad days, I no longer spend entire weeks or months stuck in depressive rumination.

I know I could allow my depression it to consume my life within an instant, however it is a privilege I do not allow.

This in no way makes the instant rush of crushing hopelessness any less intense than it has ever been. I am still just as impressionable and as vulnerable as I have always been. My thoughts are certainly no less unpredictable or unreasonable.

Mental illness has always been a matter of human design and as long as we have the capacity to feel guilt, shame etc. then there will always be depression.

What I do have now, however, is the confidence, technique and understanding required to grasp and have a handle over my depression.

No longer is depression this pervasive aspect of my personality. In fact, I am happy, motivated and functioning most of the time.

When my depression does take a hold of me however, it usually takes a few hours to a day at most to come to my senses. Sometimes it can take a few days if I have particularly bad episode, however this is now a rare occassion

Hopefully this article can shed some light on how I manage my own depression, so that you can have the same confidence that I do.


### Understanding our scripts.


A large part of managing our depression comes down to prevention.

This relies on understanding the process of how our thoughts work, well before we allow ourselves to spiral into anxiety, panic, mania, then complete hopelessness.

Prevention becomes more difficult to enforce the further we get dragged into our rumination, which is why it is important to act promptly.

This prevention exists in the form of a process, which hopes to interpret and dissect the internal dialogue (or the script) that we play in our minds.

Our script is the narrative that we play in our mind which promotes the bad or faulty logic leading our depression.

For example, it could be our script which leads us to a feeling worthlessness or guilt or shame, perhaps because of events which have happened in the past, which have little to do who we are today.

By understanding the scripts that we play in our minds through a process, we can learn to dissect them and point out the faulty logic inherent within them.


### Repeating our scripts.


The problem we have is that we tend to keep replaying these scripts in our mind.

It could be that we never addressed the faulty logic of our script in the first place.

The other main reason is because we continually fail to remember the faulty logic contained within the script, so that when the script plays in our mind, we feel just as vulnerable and hopeless each time.

It may only be one month or even one week and yet these scripts come back to haunt us, as if we had never seen them before. This issue arises because we have lost perspective of our depression.

In addition, there are also hundreds of potential scripts that we can play our in our mind, all from different angles, many of which we repeat time and time again without even being consciously aware of it.

Of course, not this does not mean we are hopeless.

It simply emphasises the importance of self-awareness, acceptance and critical thinking. By mastering these skills, we can not only become comfortable with calming ourselves down before anxiety onsets, however we can also learn to address our faulty logic efficiently and with little resistance.


### When we lose focus.


One of the main reasons why I forget my scripts is because I’m so focused on my goals and ambitions that I completely lose perspective of my depression and particularly, my potential for depression.

It is almost like a form of arrogance of my behalf.  Whenever I lose focus of my ambition it almost feels as if my life purpose has been sucked out of me.

This usually happens whenever I'm too busy to pursue my ambitions, if I have a particularly bad day or I fall physically sick and it feels as if my reality has become shattered. I instantly feel hopeless.

This is because when we narrow our focus to become incredibly effective with our immediate goals, we also allow ourselves to become incredibly vulnerable within this focus as well.

We lose perspective of our lives, because we box ourselves into this inflexible mindset where the goal is the only thing that matters. We fail to empathise with our own feelings and circumstances as a result and we begin to suffer emotionally once these things change unpredictably out of our control.

The dangerous flipside of this narrow mindset, is that we end up paying all of our attention to our feelings of hopelessness and guilt for not being able to pursue our goals, instead of the most efficient path to get back to pursing these goals.

We end up taking our own circumstances much too personally for no benefit, other than to justify our own ego.

This is why it is important to live in balance with our perspective so that we can maintain our ambition without feeling necessarily obliged or committed to something which may end up harming us.


### Regaining hope.


Even losing a tiny amount of focus can cause us to spiral into hopelessness and depression within an instant. It is the result of a failure to maintain perspective.

Maintaining perspective and preventing ourselves from boxing ourselves emotionally and logically with our focus is critical to becoming more effective and stable with our own lives.

It is about being flexible with our thoughts and attitudes, rather than inflexible and stuck in identity.

This is why it is important to always ask lots of questions and more importantly, to empathise and accept our own circumstances for what they are, rather than what our focus suggests they should be.

We do this by maintaining an open attitude and perspective in life, which accommodates us in both times of optimism and pessimism.

While we may not be able to choose our circumstances, we do have the ability to choose the attitudes towards them.

Through self-awareness and self-understanding, we can truly learn to manage our depression and more effectively, prevent it from ever occurring. It will take time... and obviously, perspective.
