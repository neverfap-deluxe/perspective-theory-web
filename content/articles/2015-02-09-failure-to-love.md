A few days ago I was writing an article for Perspective Theory.

I would like to think that a lot of thought goes into writing these articles. They require a lot of logic to construct and they have to be equally helpful as well. After three hours of work however, once I had finished my article, I decided to click the 'save draft' button when the page decided to crash.

None of it could be retrieved. All my hard work had gone.

It is in moments like these that we can find it difficult to love ourselves. We can find it easy to let ourselves fall into a spiral of self-criticism and worthlessness. We feel frustrated and cheated. All that time seemingly wasted and for what?

Yet in lieu of all this, I actually managed to stay quite calm. I did not react in any bad manner, and life went on as per usual.


### Learning to accept who we are.


I mean, do not get me wrong. It sucks. There was a moment of disbelief when it all happened, however my rationality kicked it. I knew there was absolutely no point overreacting. There was no point in being frustrated.

I simply accepted the situation and moved on.

I talk a lot about acceptance and I believe it is fundamental in situations like these, where we feel our reality has been ultimately turned upside down and this really is the beautiful of acceptance, is that it shows how little reality actually has changed.

I still had my arms and legs. I still retained my ability to write and live and breathe. It made me realise that I still had the responsibility within myself to be happy and productive. Really, nothing had changed.

A large part of acceptance is learning not to take things personally. When you take something personally, you invest yourself and become emotionally effected. This includes self-criticism and a feeling of rage, all entities which serve our emotions, rather than the underlying cause of these emotions: our ability to produce logic.


### Loving what we do not appreciate.


Naturally it is more difficult for us not to take things personally when the consequence of actions may be due to our own inability. It could be that we are dyslexic, or that we have some form of disability which prevents us from being who we want to.

In my case not only did I lose all my writing, however because of my poor memory, I had no ability to recall everything I just wrote. I could barely remember any of it which is a queue to feel terrible about myself.

To make things worse, I developed an aversion to what I had just written. Losing all that information had left a bad taste in my mouth, and so I had to take a break from it.

It always comes down to how you can calm yourself and let your logic take over, rather than your emotions. It is about taking control of yourself so that you can be most effective, rather than most irrational.


### When love is conditional.


Many of us find it difficult to love ourselves because of the way create and view this idea of love in life. Some of us make love out to be this idea that is purely conditional.

We believe that love must be the result of our perceived successes and failures, rather than an emotion that we express in our hearts. We manipulate ourselves to view love through a narrow corridor, rather than an attractive lifestyle.

We choose to love ourselves once we have done something that we feel warrants love. As a result of this logic we also choose to hate ourselves when things fall apart. It is a horrible duality of the mind that does nothing to enhance our outcome.

This is why it is important to learn to love for what it is - a simple feeling that we evoke within ourselves. Acceptance comes a long way to helping us promote things.

It is about understanding that there is love in everything if we choose to see it. We are surrounded by love and alternatively, surrounded by hate depending on what we personally choose to feel.

Of course, this may sound surreal in many respects, however it is what we are ultimately aiming for in the end and I guarantee it is very real.


### How we perceive logic.


Without a neutral mindset which embraces effective logic, our mind will find ways to create opportunities for anger and negative emotions. Without neutrality we end up dumbing down our logic to fit our emotional narrative.

It can be easy to see all that time lost as being 'wasted' when equally it could also be viewed as 'well spent'. Does my dilemma present myself as a problem or an opportunity?

More importantly, which mindset helps me serve my aims better? The mindset where I let my emotions take over or the one where I am in-control of my emotions?

This is why it helps to think of our lifestyle choices in terms of actions vs consequences, rather than using our feelings to guide us.

Regardless, I am fine now and I am glad with how I dealt with the situation. Certainly, there must be some merit to my method.
