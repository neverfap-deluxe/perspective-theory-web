The transition to from depression to happiness can be difficult.

I know, it may sound utterly absurd to even be writing this article, however I just want you to think back to your most recent experiences with happiness.

When was the last time you felt truly happy with yourself and your life? Are your experiences with happiness usually long-lasting and are they purely situational? Does it only serve as a temporary distraction from the problems in your life?

One of the reasons we struggle with depression is not necessarily because we are depressed, but because we misunderstand what it means to be happy and it is something we usually find out once we do find stable happiness in our lives.

I am writing this article because I am currently in this position of stable happiness and it is something I am struggling with. Naturally we understand our state of depression much better than we do our state of happiness.

Depression is something that we live with on a daily basis, while stable happiness is something that is foreign to most of us. That is not to say that we have not experienced happiness in the past, but that we have not truly accustomed ourselves to a life of happiness.

That is to say that just like our depression, embracing happiness is something that takes practice and perspective to truly understand and embrace this newly found mindset.


### The cycle of depression.


My emotional past consists of enduring the endless cycles of depression and anxiety.

If I was not permanently depressed for months at a time, then I found myself bobbing between hopelessness and moments of euphoria. In the off chance that I did find the courage and perspective to overcome my depression, my happiness would last a few weeks at most, before reaching some form of instability and falling back into depression.

It was horrible because I would consciously cycle between these states over and over again without knowing why and as you can imagine, that creates a number of emotional and mental complications, particularly with your self-esteem.

Recently however I have managed to remain happy and stable for quite a few weeks running and when I do have my somewhat minor episodes, I am back up and running within a few days. It honestly feels like a miracle.

The fact that anyone with depression is able to remain emotionally stable for more than a few days is a huge feat. My main aim for the time being is to study the way I feel, so hopefully I can remain happy and stable for the rest of my life.

The best thing about experience stability is that each time you learn something new about yourself and how best to manage your mindset.

I can certainly attest that it created a lot of valuable perspective in my own mind and it is something I would like to share today with you. Not only how to best accustom yourself with happiness, but hopefully address some of the misconceptions and dilemmas that people run into once becoming stable.


### Embracing emotional stability.


If you are susceptible to depression and have remained depressed for a large majority of your life, achieving any amount of stability is an extraordinary effort.

To achieve stability is really to expose and resist all the doubt, fear and insecurity that we have within ourselves and managing our stability, largely has to do with understanding that it is not in our best interest to be any of those things.

One big misconception people have of stability is that it is a privilege.

Stability, just like perspective and self-awareness, takes time and effort to be effective. The secret is that even though I am stable, I know I can just as easily become depressed and hopeless within a second.

Just because someone is stable, does not mean that they are any less vulnerable to their own depression or mental illness.  It simply means that they are willing to give it a shot and do everything in their power to make it work.

One thing we learn through our stability, is that through our mental illness we try and constantly find ways in our mind to sabotage our positivity and well-being. To be stable is to acknowledge that there is a higher purpose to avoiding sabotage in our own lives, which can be a difficult mindset to maintain in our lives, especially once we experience emotional lows during our stability.

Just like in the chaos of depression, the stability also contains a spectrum of emotions and feelings which we are not familiar with and can often catch us off guard since we do not know how to respond or react.

This is why it is important to develop strategies to deal with happiness, much in the same way that we have with depression and this is something that can only come from experience.

This is also why it is important to resist sabotaging our happiness no matter how badly our mind rejects our feelings. We must always try and find opportunities and outlets to try and deal with our problems.


### Sabotaging new points of view.


For example, people often have difficult creating ambition in their lives when they are happy.

We become so accustomed to doing everything from a depressive state that the moment, we start acting out of our own happiness, we almost break down in frustration and confusion.

This is why people end up going back to depression, because they assume that we should already be accustomed to happiness, like it is a natural functioning state.

To make matters worse some people then make the assumption that depression is their natural state of being, leaving our hopes of happiness or stability for another time, if there is one. We simply feel more comfortable and familiar in our own misery.

This is just one of the ways in which we sabotage ourselves, which is why it important to think of stability not as a privilege or something mystical, but as a skill that we need to learn and develop.

Stability, just like depression, has a learning curve.

While we are learning however, we need to give ourselves a chance to by focusing on the real benefits of what happiness and stability can have to your life. Otherwise we merely repeat and trap ourselves within the same cycle of depression, over and over again.

What happiness offers is the whole gives ourselves the ability to do everything we want, without the friction of self-doubt or fear. It is a way of advancing in our lives without the confusion and wrath of our emotions.

Of course, there is no point trying to convey urgency. It something that you need to come to terms with yourself. The only hope I can offer is that stability is entirely attainable and the tools are out there to help you achieve it.

It is simply a matter of believing in yourself and your ability to achieve it.
