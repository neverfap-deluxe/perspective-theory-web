The word ‘neutral’ often elicits a very negative connotation. It is seen as something impartial to progress – as if the alternative to neutrality, conflict and disagreement, is the only way to come to any coherent conclusion. This is ironic considering that neutrality itself is neither negative, nor positive.

Google defines the word neutral as “having no strongly marked or positive characteristics or features.” So why is emotional neutrality vital to our lives, if it is so seemingly benign and eerie?

To understand the logic behind these misconceptions, we have to dig a little deeper into how we associate with neutrality in our lives.

### Why we were never taught neutrality.


You see, we don’t associate with neutrality at all. Instead of using words like ‘accept’ or ‘embrace’ for things we’re impartial or indifferent to, we more often use words such as ‘tolerate’ or ‘stand for.’ Humans are very rarely neutral and it’s a cause for a lot of the emotional pain we experience in our lives.

There’s a twisted duality that we have in our minds. It’s the idea that if there is a good, then there must be a bad. It’s the very basis for our culture, which is predicated upon the set of morals we were brought up with – an idea that our actions can either lead to good or bad consequences. It’s the very system of logic that our parents used to motivate us and encourage us to do either good things or avoid doing bad.

If you did something good, then you were rewarded. If you did something bad, then you were punished. Of course, the rules weren’t according to how our actions made us feel, be it positive or negative, but rather because of what our parents told us was right or wrong.

As you can imagine, this is an easily corruptible system of thought. If a parent is in a bad mood or is naturally abusive or spiteful, then our actions can be used to manipulate us and confuse us. We can be scolded for perfectly acceptable behaviour or even discouraged from doing things that may benefit us.

You can read more about how this dynamic functions here in this article. The point is that we’ve never been taught neutrality as a system of motivation, to help us better understand who we are. We were never told that we could simply exist and do things out of our own will, rather than through a system of right or wrong.


### Neutrality as an ideal system of thought.


It’s best to look at neutrality as a form of peace, as well as a strong alternative to the incessant judgments that we create for ourselves in order to sift our way through the maze of rules and contradictions of what we consider right or wrong.

Now that we’re older and wiser, rather than impressionable children, we no longer need to rely on these outdated standards of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to dictate our actions. We have logic. We have reason. We have everything we need to make positive, long-lasting decisions in our life.

In fact, part of the reason why we fail to make positive or fruitful decisions in our lives, is because of our inability to remain neutral and not allow our morals to dictate how we should act or behave.

By remaining neutral, we can prevent ourselves from giving up our personal power to our morals and instead, focus on how on our actions make us truly feel. When we allow our judgments get in the way of how we feel, then naturally this demoralises us and makes us feel terrible in lieu of the aspirations and pursuits we have in life.

Unfortunately, instead of the questioning the way we think and feel, we instead force ourselves along the path of progress until we mentally break down. This confuses us even further and makes us questions our goals and aspirations, instead of the logic behind our actions.

Maintaining a neutral perspective is a concise way of avoiding these negative emotional reactions, by giving us a choice to react more rationally and effectively.
