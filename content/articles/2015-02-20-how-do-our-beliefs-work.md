All of our beliefs are borne from the agreements we make about ourselves and our reality. It helps to think of our beliefs as the intellectual structures of our mind which define how we think and feel.

Our beliefs begin as agreements in our mind, then later form to become solid structures or intellectual institutes we entrust in. Over time these ideas can erode or strengthen depending on the experiences we have in life.

Whether these beliefs are beneficial or not are irrelevant to the structures of the mind. Many of our harmful beliefs have simply been reinforced subconsciously (or even consciously) without us knowing it.

Beliefs themselves can have a harmful or positive impact on our lives. What’s important however is to recognise how we can change these harmful beliefs, by addressing the false assumptions and agreements that underpin them.

Generally speaking, the reason for our harmful beliefs is because of the false assumptions we make about who we are and the ways we reinforce these beliefs on a daily basis.


### How we form beliefs.


One of the ways in which we can understand our beliefs is to simply make a ridiculous agreement in your mind.

You can say, "As of today, I’m going to be petrified of cups" and I want you to try and convince yourself that cups are absolutely the most terrifying thing on earth.

Yet even though we’ve made this agreement, it still feels inherently dishonest. The reason is because even if we tell ourselves or make an agreement in our minds, it in no ways produces fear whenever we look at cups. We still view them as being relatively harmless.

Furthermore, we already have this prior agreement that cups do not scare us and this is reinforced by all the experiences in the past that we have had with cups. A cup has never threatened our sense of security or come alive and attacked. We have generalised our experiences with cups and formed them into our beliefs about them. .

In fact we have so much faith with this agreement that it is almost unbreakable.

This is why it is important to pay attention to the words that we use on a daily basis, because if we constantly reinforce a particularly agreement, such as the judgments we make on a daily basis, then our feelings can eventually learn to chase these words.


### How we give power to beliefs.


So to create a sense of genuine honesty, I want you to associate a cup with something that really terrifies you. It could be a person you really despise, it could be the image of a violent man breaking the cup on your face, there are many things that we fear. Perhaps a living cup made entirely of spiders that breaks apart and crawls all over your body.

Create a really vivid image of this fear in your mind. In all your surroundings, that cup is the most vile, terrible thing you’ve ever witnessed and it fills you with so much anger and hate, that all you want to do is grab that destroy all evidence that this cup ever existed.

They are horrible, disgusting and intrepid. They walk over you and tell you what to do and they are horrible. You refuse to stare at them, let alone acknowledge they exist.


### The emotional narrative.


Once we get our emotions going it becomes a part of the experience and it ends up reinforcing the narrative of our agreements. If this process is successful, then our agreements form into effective beliefs with a particularly underlying assumption or generalisation.

As you can see, it is an intricate process that we may not be aware of. It is also easily abused and exaggerated by our own actions and thoughts.

If we can manage to be honest with ourselves, that is to not exaggerate our emotions or agreements, as well as admit that our assumptions may be incorrect, then we can successfully prevent ourselves from having emotionally manipulative and harmful beliefs.

Harmful beliefs are usually easy to identify... simply because they cause us harm. There is no reason why people should harm themselves as a form of effective motivation, yet many of us use judgment for this very task.

It is about being skeptical, simply as a way of understanding how our minds work.

Likewise, many fears are borne out of false agreements. It is not until we uncover these agreements, that we can then move on and better dictate our emotions and reality.


### Picking apart our beliefs.


Our first step is to identity the agreements that we have made. It is important to understand that most negative beliefs are predicated upon dishonesty, rather than honesty. They are based in false assumptions rather than true.

This is can be difficult, especially if these agreements are biased and backed by how our reality and these agreements make us feel. It is difficult to directly change our agreements, however exposing them for what they are, usually achieves this to great effect. This is part of the importance of observing ourselves and our behaviours.

It also helps to find out where we are attributing our emotions. Ask yourself which beliefs makes you angry or sad. What agreements you potentially have that are making you trigger certain actions or behaviours

Already by understanding that these attitudes require a large degree of faith to uphold is half of the step towards changing your beliefs.

Usually by identifying the false assumptions we make, everything else will usually follow.
