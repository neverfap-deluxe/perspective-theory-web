Many of us struggle with self-control.

It could be through our addiction responses or the habits we develop over the years. When these behaviours get out of hand we can feel like an emotional and logical mess.

We crave control in our lives because it makes us feel less dyslexic and manic with who we are. With control comes focus and power and these are skills we must develop in order to have control over ourselves.

With this control we create choice and direction in our lives and it is a kind of freedom that liberates us from fear and anxiety.

Sometimes we enjoy the craziness of being drunk or even the irrational exuberance of gambling money, however behaviours resulting in panic attacks or emotional insufficiency has been seldom described as pleasant.


### Is self-control a simple matter of discipline?


Through my own experiences with addiction and depression, I feel mostly in-control of my behaviours and desires. I'm not perfect, however I'm largely intact with who I am.

In a sense I do not think that our desires truly go away. I believe it the process of self-control is more about coming to an appreciation and understanding of who we are, which gives us more freedom to make choices without feeling guilt or shame.

As a result I am no longer obsessed with the vices of my past, if not sparingly and in social moderation.

Self-control is not as perplexing as we think it is. Self-control is a simple matter of understanding who we are and as we slowly begin to understand how our own mind functions, perplexing ideas like addiction can become entirely manageable.

At face value our lack of control can seem to stem from a basic lack of discipline. Laziness.

We think in our minds that if only we just tried harder, if we were to resist and be normal, that maybe we would be successful in controlling who we are.

This is very dogmatic and ineffective way of thinking about self-control. If self-control were as easy as the amount of effort we expended to try and change it, then very few people would have issues.

Rather this attitude towards self-control does not truly express who we can help ourselves because it focuses on the problem, not the solution.

Self-control is not the cause for why we do things, it is merely a symptom of an effective way of living. Passion is the reason we overcome our addictions and behaviours. Our motive drives us to change, not merely overcoming our problems.


### When we focus on our problems.


Problems are not a black and white.

They do not exist and then disappear. Rather, problems are a symptom that stem from having a lack of conceivable benefit or solution in our life.

If we focus on this question of "How can I quit smoking?" this is no way helps us quit smoking. It merely signifies the problem and worse of all, it puts the problem in our immediate focus.

Instead we need to focus on what is important to us, because the solution is not in the problem itself. The solution is in the big picture and our vision of what we want.

If we want to give up smoking then it is not effective to merely focus on quitting smoking. This does not provide a viable alternative in our life (the solution), otherwise we merely take up another destructive behaviour to replace our current vice.

We need to focus on what is truly important in our lives so we can create focus and direction. If you maybe think about the money that you could be saving from not buying cigarettes and how that can help you in the future, then you divert your thinking away from smoking.

It is about prioritising our vision of who we want to be.

If we focus on the big picture of how we can help ourselves to live more meaningful and fulfilling lives, then we can create leverage our emotions.

We should be asking questions like "How can I be healthier?" or "How can I live a more meaningful lifestyle?" because it is in these philosophies that our actions follow suit.

One of the reasons why I was addicted to pornography was not because of the pornography persay, but because I had no via ambition or life purposes.

Of course, this is only the beginning. I did actually have ambition in my life, I simply was unable to embrace it and emphasis it and visualise it in my mind. This is an article for another time.

However the moment I starting placing more emphasis on my goals and what was important to me and my vision, pornography no longer became an for issue. It did not even enter my mind because my focus was on my goals (the solution), not on my problems.

It is ultimately about having an optimistic attitude towards our life.


### Control over our emotions.


Obviously one of the main things to consider is the emotional component attached to our harmful desires.

Naturally our emotions tamper with us and take away from our ability to focus, so naturally those with addictions or depressions find it difficult to change.

For whatever reason many people are under the impression that they need to fight their emotions or desires with an iron fist.

This is a very tortuous and ineffective way to live and sadly this is how many people live their lives - against their emotions and desires, as opposed to flowing with them and guiding them towards something more pleasant.

A much simpler way of dealing with our habits is to observe them and understand our beliefs and dissect why we pursue them. Many of our actions are predicated upon the hidden beliefs that we have of ourselves and these are aspects of our psyche that we need to uncover.

We usually compensate with our emotions by increasing our dopamine levels through drugs, food and dangerous behaviours. This creates a feedback response which tampers with our emotions so that we end up dependent on these things to keep our emotions in check.

In a lot of other cases however our emotional imbalance can be caused by our diets and lifestyles. A lack of sleep can easily trigger a state of depression. Poor food choices can make us feel lethargic and even sick.

Of course it is important to understand that while our emotions are important, they are not a definite version of reality.

Our emotions merely exist to indicate us of our situation, like the red and green lights at an intersection.

When we are irrational, these lights can display the wrong signals and this is how we end up doing things we regret like taking excessive drugs or resorting to a jaded attitude towards life.

Learning not to take our emotions personally is something which can help people.


### How to take back control.


Control comes down to having a keen observance and curiosity for who we are.

In essence it is about learning to be self-aware in every aspect, from understanding ourselves down to our understanding the context and knowledge for how humans function, from our thoughts to our beliefs and our emotions.

It is something this website hopes to offer.
