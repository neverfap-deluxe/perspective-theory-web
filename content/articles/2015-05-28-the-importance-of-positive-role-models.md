We often are preached about the importance of having positive role models in our life.

The issue is that we largely misunderstand what role models are, as well as the extent to which they have influence in our lives.

Many of us have a jaded idea of what a role model is. There is a stereotype that role models are a collective group of hyper-successful individuals that cast a vastly unrealistic expectation of what reality should be.

We typically picture celebrities or super-heroes as being traditional role models. Interestingly enough, very few of us consider animals or non-tangible objects as being role models. Yet, it is because of these kinds of misconceptions that we end up growing cynical of others who are successful in life, and even at our own ability to achieve our goals and ambitions.

When we discount understanding what role models are, we inevitably discount ourselves in the process.


### What are role models?


Contrary to popular belief, everyone you know, see and engage with is a role model. Everyone has a different influence in terms of their role in society. Our parents tend to have a great deal of influence as role models in our lives, and often we are our own greatest role model.

Humans are impressionable of the people they meet and observe, not just of the celebrities and figureheads we read about in the newspaper, but at a local level. Everyone we encounter, from our friends to our work colleagues, play a different role in our lives and this affects the way that we define and view the world.

These definitions are important because through them, we understand and define ourselves. There is a fatal assumption that we can pick and choose the role models in our life, but it's not dependent on our preferences - our aspirations are different from our influences.

Our parents influence us and we can pick up their traits growing up. It is simply a matter of exposure and the kinds of environment that we are used to being part of. Our brains have a habit of absorbing information unconsciously through our senses.

It's not to say that we are completely helpless in our lives, however we need to be incredibly mindful and critical of our experiences in life so that we can remain objective and retain an air of clarity of our reality to refrain from delusion.

By exposing ourselves to different standards, we can either exaggerate or dissolve our experiences of world.


### The importance of role models.


Role models are important because they demonstrate a capacity for us to aspire to. Our role models demonstrate a local language and sense of hope that we have come to relate to in life.

If everyone we know works in a factory then chances are that our expectations and aspirations will also be geared towards working in a factory as well. It can be very difficult to open a pet shop if we don’t know any pet shop owners or if we have never owned a pet in our life.

Of course being trapped within our local culture is now a thing of the past with the advent of internet and social media, though this can also have the effect of trivialising our expectations.

Role models serve as a way of humanising our aspirations, but it first means exposing ourselves to inspiring role models. This also means we need to change our perception of their function in society.

One of the reasons why we can become cynical about role models is because of our own failures in life or because of the negative experiences that we have had with people in our life. So instead of becoming inspired, we merely reject everyone’s point of view and attempt to do things the hard way - through trial and error.

While this is understandable, especially if our role models in life are unhealthy, this also denotes the ability to learn from the wisdom of those who have been more successful than us. Though interestingly enough, our cynical attitudes actually have little to do with anyone else. They mostly derive from the way that we view ourselves as people.

If we believe that we are incapable or that something is impossible to achieve, that is not a reflection of other people’s success, but of our own attitude. The reason why understanding this is so important, especially in terms of having positive role models, is because it demonstrates that we are all equally talented and capable in life.

It comes down to the kinds of ideas that we expose ourselves to and how well we believe in ourselves as individuals. When we isolate ourselves from these ideals then it can make these aspirations seem almost absurd and unobtainable.

The idea is that we can only truly empathise with what we have experience with or exposure to. If we have been depressed all our lives, then that is the lens through which we see the world.


### Embracing different points of view.


The message of this article is to emphasise the importance of other people’s self-discovery rather than just our own. Often the biggest advances in my mental health have not been through my own thoughts, but from the thoughts of others.

Sometimes it can be helpful to have a balance of positive and negative influences in our lives. Personally speaking I see no need for people who provide sadness or trauma to my own life and this is part of defining our principles as people of who we want to become.

My girlfriend, my friends, the random strangers I talk to over the internet - just about everyone has a different perspective on life that can help us broaden our horizons. Of course it is important to make our own mind up as to who has a truly positive or negative influence on our lives, and this can be the most difficult and challenging part of suffering from mental illness.
