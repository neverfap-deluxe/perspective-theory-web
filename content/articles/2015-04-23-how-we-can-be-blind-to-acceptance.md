I came up with an analogy today which I think might be helpful.

I used to struggle quite poorly in regards to my first break up. My issue was that I idolised her and romanticised everything about our relationship, which created unrealistic expectations in my mind that devastated me once we broke up.

It felt like being told that you would never be able to see light again on a level that ruined the very meaning of love and beauty I had come to recognise.

I had a perfection mindset in regards to our relationship and my life. In the beginning I felt that everything was perfect, even with our flaw,  and believed that things would continue to remain perfect well into the future.

I set myself up with false expectations that I could not meet, and so naturally I was destined for emotional suffering. These expectations mindsets can be so powerful that they can give us the impression that destiny is real and that our lives are naturally destined to be grand.

Of course it is not until things fall apart that our reality breaks down and we have difficult dealing with the so-called perfection that we have lost.

We can have these feelings of broken destiny if we did not get into the course we wanted at university or any other aspect of our lives that we so strongly believed in but did not work out.

We are only limited to our imagination and the things in life that we have been greatly passionate about.


### The way we relate to destiny.


When we are deeply passionate about life, we begin to treat ourselves lives as if they are a kind of art.

Much like the art of persuasion or the art of love, we begin to think about the ways in which we craft reality and develop the skills to maintain the level of reality we destined to seize.

If it is a relationship, we try and craft the most beautiful romances that we labor our self-worth into and if we are concerned with our jobs, then we feel skillful whenever we impress higher up or garner a promotion.

When we become so enthralled in the world, our passions become our pieces to master and once we become obsessed, it can feel as if we are destined to create these pieces of art.

It is a vital expectation that we create of ourselves that if broken, would be to suggest that our destiny has been shattered and we are no longer worthy of passion.

Once something does go wrong, we revert to self-criticism to deal with the discrepancy and in lieu of total failure, we force an intense amount of guilt and shame over our lives that completely destroys everything about us.

To deal with this guilt and shame, we decide to embrace the feelings of grandeur that we would have otherwise imagined if we had stayed our course to perfection.

We picture ourselves with our past partners, feeling happy just as we always imagined it would be. We pretend that we are self-important when we have nothing. We do absolutely everything but abandon the hopes and dreams of the destiny we once believed in.


### Destiny is like a beautiful image.


So back to my analogy and how it can help us better grasp our understanding of who we are.

I was looking through some beautiful paintings on Google and I came to the realisation that my first relationship is a lot like a beautiful painting or a fine piece of art.

As creators of destiny, we spend our time trying to craft this painting into the most beautiful wonder the world has ever seen. So much so that we very rarely take the time to simply admire the beauty of our creation.

We spend all our effort focusing on what it should be, rather than what it is: a piece of beauty wrapped in time.

Then once we finish our piece or our we are unable to work our piece anymore due to unforeseen circumstances, we spend so much time criticising and hating ourselves for not having the opportunity to continue our work, rather than simply admiring what we have created.

We live in the expectation, rather than in reality.

Very rarely do we see people in an art gallery want to become the art. They simply attend to admire the art, then move on.

Yet when we become so enthralled and passionate with our own work, we can become obsessed to the point of wanting to become the art. We want to become something which is not real and can only be admired.

Looking back, I really did want to become that picture more than anything. It was an image I was hopelessly obsessed with, however I now realise that it is just harmful fantasy that exists only in my mind.


### Embracing acceptance.


This article is about acceptance.

We spend so much time worrying about how we are going to deal with the pain or who we are as people, that we completely overlook  the fact that we do not have to suffer at all.

Acceptance is difficult, however through analogies like these, we can better understand ways to find acceptance in our lives and come to terms with ourselves.

In this analogy, acceptance is not about giving into our emotions or delusion. It is about seeing our circumstances more a different point of view so that we do not have to be ravaged via expectation, but see things from a more neutral point of view.

Another perspective that can help is to view everything as being made of energy.

That way everything is equal as it is beautiful.
