To have emotion is to be human.

There is nothing particularly wrong with being emotional, even in the realm of sadness, frustration, anger or any other type of emotion that we have come to describe as negative.

It is entirely healthy to experience negative emotions, just as it is to experience the joy of living. Not only does it demonstrate that you are normal, however it is to be expected throughout life.

Repressing our emotions however is not normal and is can lead to a lot of bad and harmful consequences down the road. The reason why it is important to express and keep our emotions open, is because they help us explain and indicate our feelings towards life.

When we fail to embrace and express our emotions honestly, we end up giving ourselves the wrong signals as to how we truly feel about life and this can lead to delusional thinking and irrational decision making.

We end up confusing ourselves thinking that we can simply ignore our emotions, when the only choice we really have is to understand the embrace them.


### Why we repress our emotions.


Repressing our emotions can seem like an easy way out to our emotional suffering and naturally, when we become so utterly confused and desperate in life, it may seem like the only possible solution.

We barely understand how we feel, nor why we feel the way we do and so we start tinkering with the way we think as a way to cope with the insanity.

The primary way we repress our emotions is through fear.

We attaching negative images or beliefs to certain emotions, people or even ideas as a way to deter us from experiencing these negative emotions again.

The problem is that since our emotions are a capacity rather than a switch, it is impossible to prevent these emotions from recurring and making yourself fearful of them merely empowers their effect. We also become neurotic and impressionable when we are depression, so using fear or any kind of negative belief to counter our own dysfunction is a recipe for disaster that mere feeds back into our mental illness.

This becomes even worse if our emotions are caused directly by our own circumstance, such as from repeat abuse, as it simply amplifies how helpless we truly are at repressing our emotions.

Repressing our emotions simply has the effect of exaggerating our emotions further and further until we become entirely dysfunctional.

This is because we distort and interfere with the ability for our emotions to function as intended: As a way to indicate how we truly feel about ourselves and world.


### Changing our limiting beliefs.


When our emotions are honest and free, it gives us leverage over who we want to be.

To demonise our emotions through repression is comparable to saying that you hate the itchiness of a mosquito bite. The itchiness is not the primary cause of the problem, it is merely the symptom. The issue is that you are outside, bare naked, where there are lots of mosquitos ready to feed.

We need to focus on the cause of the problem, not the symptom. If we continue to hang around mosquitos and condemn the condition of our actions, then we will get nowhere.

While we can accept and embrace the fact that we are being bitten, which is certainly one of the ways to deal with our problems, addressing the cause is the preferred method for most people.

The first thing we need to do however, is to change the limiting beliefs that we have of our emotions. We need to stop viewing our emotions as something inherently bad or that needs to be micromanaged or repressed.

There is nothing wrong with our emotions and there is nothing wrong with being excessively emotional. It merely means you have the capacity to experience the breadth of life, which is a truly amazing thing.

We must understand that our emotions are not idle and that they are propelled by our thoughts, feelings and beliefs of the world. We must accept that negative emotions are a necessary and healthy part of life, that we become sad and angry for a reason.

Of course, as we become more self-aware, we can learn to avoid sadness and anger (to an extent) through perspective and looking at things from different points of view. It’s all a matter of practice.


### Embracing our emotions through self-awareness.


The aim of mastering our self-awareness has nothing to do with being happy all the time.

If you would like to be happy all the time then certainly that is an option, however self-awareness is about giving us choice over who we want to be, as to help us understand the consequences of our actions with confidence.

It is about giving us the resilience to function, rather than trying and avert function to produce the same result. Our emotions do not have to be confusing, however it requires that we first address ourselves along with our limiting beliefs and understandings of what emotions are and should be.

By mastering our emotions through context and understanding, we no longer have to feel limited and dysfunctional with ourselves and our feelings.

It means we can experience a wide range of emotions, from anger to sadness, knowing that we are ultimately in-control of ourselves as well as understanding why we feel these ways.

Most importantly it means that we can experience the sheer brilliance of life from all it’s angles without fear of who we are. Everything then becomes beautiful, no matter the joy or tragedy.
