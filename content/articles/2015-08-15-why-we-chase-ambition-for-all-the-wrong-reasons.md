**Overview:** People often hook their attention between dozens of many different goals and ambitions. While ambition can be a positive thing, when we rely on these short bursts of desperation to develop our self-worth it can be invariably destructive. This article discusses the importance of discovering purpose in our ambition, why we chase ambition fruitlessly, how we disguise ego for passion as well as how we can avoid repeating these cycles of disappointment.

The onset of ambition excites us.

It carries us away into states of desire that can have us binge eating out of depression or achieving the most amazing things in the world.

Ambition itself is like a double edged sword and learning how to control and use it wisely is necessary to avoid converting our drive into something dysfunctional.

While it is undoubtedly important to have ambition, many people simply use ambition as a short term solution to their problems without knowing it. They jump from ambition to ambition without truly discovering purpose or meaning in their lives and they end up as self-defeated as they were initially.

I know I was (and perhaps still am) culprit to these cycles.

In the past I would attempt to learn 5 different languages over the space of a year, not to mention the hundreds of different hobbies I would become immediately disinterested in within a matter of weeks.

One of the reasons why we aspire onto learn new things, meet new people, satisfy new relationship goals etc. is to inspire ourselves to become something more than who we perceive we are - worthless and incapable.

No one is arguing that having these visions unimportant. It is very important to have goals and visions in life.

However when we are compelled to have these goals and visions because of our feelings of inadequacy, our goals and ambitions can simply become another layer of insecurity to deal with.

It is in this sense that we are not so much inspired by our ambitions, so much that we are self-defeated, desperate and willing to try anything.

Inspiration is not about battling an identity we have within ourselves. It is about creating a sense of passion that neither takes nor demands anything from us.

Continually drifting from ambition to ambition is a sign that we may be chasing these goals and visions for all the wrong reasons.

Understanding the cycle of ambition.

Cycles can be best thought of as a paradigm.

They are paradigms because they trap us into a rhythm of predictable behaviour that we remain seemingly unaware of.

These cycles are borne out of desperation and are not healthy or sustainable because they merely serve as an unthoughtful reaction to our problems, rather than as an attentive solution based in confidence and empowerment.

In most cases our cycles can go a little something like this: We discover something that hooks our attention.

It could be the prospect of learning a new skill or becoming a certain persona. It hooks our attention because we believe it will counter our feelings of inadequacy and provide us hope for the future.

It is something we do subconsciously and remain seemingly benign to.

In the process of this vision we also create an image of who we are. This image or identity provides us with a renowned sense of who we believe we are, even though it is not actually us.

It is fundamental to note that egos or identities do not actually change who we are. Ideas are just thoughts in our head and when we assume these ideas can fundamentally change who we are we run into very dangerous territory.

Ultimately we use this identity as a way of distracting ourselves from our problems in a world where we are no longer reminded by our negative thoughts and feelings. By believing we are strong we forget that we are vulnerable.

Naturally the alternative to maintaining these goals and ambitions is to instead return back to our feelings of inadequacy and lose our recently obtained hope.

In essence we develop a dependency on these identities and ambitions which we disguise as passion. Real passion is unconditional and is not dependent on the goals and ambitions that we set for ourselves.

This is to say that instead of placing our self-worth onto our problems, through our ambition we merely re-place our self-worth into our solutions. Nothing truly changes and our insecurity remains just as intact as it was before.

As I am sure you are aware, eventually we end up losing passion for these goals (as they were not based in true intention) and everything simply breaks down back to square one where we feel hollow and unsurprised.

Re-interpreting ambition in our lives.

Ambition is not a bad thing.

The point of this article is to emphasise the importance of having proper mental health first and foremost.

Proper mental health comes from observing yourself, observing your thoughts and thinking patterns, as well as gaining perspective and self-awareness in life.

While people should be encouraged to develop new skills and work on things like acceptance, gratitude, happiness - it really is about cultivating those things akin to our mental health and well-being, which is where true self-discovery begins.

In many cases ambition can fittingly provide us with a positive sense of self-esteem to tackle bigger tasks in life and prove that we are capable rather than worthless.

However we cannot rely on our ambition as an excuse to neglect our negative feelings of self-worth. They must instead be resolved on an internal level.

No amount of force, ambition or drive can help us reach acceptance.

It does not matter if you climb mount Everest or write the world's best selling book, learning to love and accept yourself is a completely separate skill that takes time and practice.

Passion should be unconditional and full of love.

A good place to start is to focus back on this idea that life should be unconditional and o develop more intricate ways of understanding acceptance.
