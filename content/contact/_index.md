A large portion of my day is spent talking to people about their mental health issues (though usually my problems as well), be it with my friends or strangers over the internet. I find the intimacy attractive and we always end up learning something each other and so it is always a valuable experience.

While I maintain that the best way to understand something is to study it inside and out, not everyone has that sort of privilege. Often the simple act of talking to someone about your issues can produce profoundly meaningful results. If you would like to know a little bit more about me and this website, please read my [about page](http://perspectivetheory.com/about/).

I currently do not charge for advice and I am more than happy to respond to your email or via the contact form below: [julius@perspectivetheory.com](mailto:julius@perspectivetheory.com)
